Just before sunrise was always {{Sam}}’s favorite part of the day. {{ Hisd(Sam) }} place wasn’t much—two-floor walk up, peeling paint, a moody oven—but it did have a view. The bedroom wall was one large piece of curved glass, and as {{ he(Sam) }} lay in bed {{ he(Sam) }} looked out over the smooth slope of the station into the chalk dust and charcoal sea of space, waiting for the sun to peek out from behind Earth.
{{ He(Sam) }} had lived in the same apartment for so long {{ he(Sam }} could tell the date just by the location of the stars. “November 1,” {{ he(Sam) }} said in a low voice. Without thinking {{ he(Sam) }} slid {{ hisd(Sam) }} hand toward {{ hisd(Sam) }} {{ wife(Rachel) }} {{Rachel}}, stopping only when {{ he(Sam) }} remembered {{ she(Rachel) }} wasn’t there. They used to talk about the stars, which ones would soon be disappearing from their mornings, which ones would be showing their faces in a few days.
{{ Hisd(Sam) }} fingers traced the cold, empty divot on {{ herd(Rachel) }} side of the bed. {{ He(Sam) }} still couldn’t bring {{ himself(Sam) }} to sleep in the middle. Then {{ he(Sam) }} remembered the significance of today’s date, and felt a tear begin to well behind {{ hisd(Sam) }} eye. {{Sam}} coughed it away and shook {{ hisd(Sam) }} head. Before another one came {{ he(Sam) }} got out of bed. {{ He(Sam) }} could skip the sunrise today.
As usual {{ he(Sam) }} got ready in exactly ten minutes. {{Rachel}} used to chide {{ him(Sam) }} for being so proud of {{ hisd(Sam) }} consistency. It used to annoy {{ him(Sam) }}, but now {{ he(Sam) }} missed {{ her(Rachel) }} scolding {{ him(Sam) }} as {{ he(Sam) }} checked the clock. In the kitchen, {{ he(Sam) }} searched for breakfast. {{ He(Sam) }} was never a cook, and since {{Rachel}} died every day seemed to be an epic struggle to find food. {{Sam}} decided—more like the empty fridge decided for {{ him(Sam) }}—to go to the Company cafeteria. The food was mediocre and {{ he(Sam) }} ate there more often than {{ he(Sam) }}’d like, but {{ he(Sam) }} didn’t want to eat alone today.
{{ He(Sam) }} walked down the two flights of stairs to the door leading out to the station’s hallway. Most of the apartments on the station had elevators, but {{ he(Sam) }} and {{Rachel}} chose one with stairs because it reminded them of pictures they had seen of ancient apartments on Earth, the ones saved from demolition now preserved in a handful of museums. Both of them liked old things, and {{Rachel}}’s hobby had been to fill their apartment with knickknacks from the past: chipped ceramic teacups, a frayed and faded woven rug, and for {{Sam}} a cracked baseball bat made of real wood. Their friends teased them about their funny tastes, but {{Sam}} knew they secretly enjoyed visiting {{Sam}} and {{Rachel}}’s apartment. It just felt different, more real somehow.
Going down the stairs made {{Sam}}’s knees ache and creak. When {{ he(Sam) }} reached the bottom {{ he(Sam) }} opened the door into the hallway. At this hour it was filled with an empty silence, not even an echo of footsteps from somewhere down the long corridor. As {{ he(Sam) }} walked, the walls beside {{ him(Sam) }} glowed with advertisements for the new B Android, following {{ him(Sam) }} like a lighted shadow. A disembodied {{ female(advertisement) }} voice read the list of features scrolling down the wall. “New features…including…more facial muscles…for real emotion…and 10% more pores…so the skin looks even more human…” {{Sam}} shook {{ hisd(Sam) }} head and tried to ignore the ads.
As {{ he(Sam) }} approached the entrance to the Company cafeteria {{ he(Sam) }} thought again of {{Rachel}}. It was a day like this {{ he(Sam) }} had met {{ her(Rachel) }} here in the cafeteria. {{ He(Sam) }} had showed up early, a brand new employee. {{ She(Rachel) }} was alone at a table. {{Sam}} had felt shy, but gathered the courage to smile at {{ her(Rachel) }}. {{Rachel}} was not shy. {{ She(Rachel) }} invited {{ him(Sam) }} over, asking {{ him(Sam) }} questions about where {{ he(Sam) }} was from and what {{ hisd(Sam) }} new job was. It turned out they were both in the customer service department, so {{ she(Rachel) }} gave {{ him(Sam) }} all sorts of advice about what to do, which people {{ he(Sam) }} should make friends with and which people {{ he(Sam) }} should avoid. By the time breakfast was over, the cafeteria was nearly full, {{Sam}} was in love, and the rest—as {{Rachel}} liked to say every time {{ she(Rachel) }} told the story—was history.
Lost in the memory, {{Sam}} didn’t realize {{ he(Sam) }} was standing in front of the lone cafeteria worker serving that early. {{ She(Carol) }} was staring at {{ him(Sam) }}. “{{Sam}}? You okay?”
The question shook {{ him(Sam) }} back to the present. “Oh, yeah. Sorry, {{Carol}}.” {{Carol}} was ancient, {{ herd(Carol) }} wrinkled skin draped loosely over {{ herd(Carol) }} body, hairnet giving order to the last of {{ herd(Carol) }} thinning strands of stark white hair. {{Sam}} was never quite able to figure {{ her(Carol) }} out. {{ She(Carol) }} spoke in a friendly tone, but it almost seemed forced, unnatural.
“Just some eggs and bacon, please. And a slice of French toast.”
“{{Sam}}?”
“Yeah?”
“I know. That’s what you always order.”
{{Sam}} smiled and shook {{ hisd(Sam) }} head. “Sorry, I guess I’m a little out of it today.”
“Oh yeah,” said {{Carol}}. “Upgrade Day.”
{{Sam}} scoffed as {{ he(Sam) }} grabbed {{ hisd(Sam) }} plate. “Upgrade Day…Upgrade Day…” {{ he(Sam) }} grumbled to {{ himself(Sam) }}. “Who cares about Upgrade Day?”
To {{ hisd(Sam) }} surprise, when {{ he(Sam) }} looked up at the endless rows of tables and chairs {{ he(Sam) }} saw {{ hisd(Sam) }} friend {{Harvey}}. {{Harvey}} had already spotted {{Sam}}, and was waving to {{ him(Sam) }} to come on over.
“Hey partner,” said {{Harvey}}. “Happy Upgrade Day!”
“Go to hell, {{Harvey}}.” {{Sam}} smiled.
“What, you’re not excited about the newest android?” A low laugh rumbled in {{Harvey}}’s prodigious belly. {{ He(Harvey) }} had salt and pepper hair that was turning more salt every day, and had started to grow out {{ hisd(Harvey) }} {{ beard(Harvey) }}. {{Sam}} sometimes teased {{ him(Harvey) }} to try out for the role of {{ Santa(Harvey) }} for the Company Christmas party.
{{Sam}} shook {{ hisd(Sam) }} head. “Meet the new droid, same as the old droid.”
“You mean you can’t tell the difference between the new A and the new B?”
“I can’t tell the difference between the T and the B,” said {{Sam}}. “Why do they need to make so many androids they have to go back to the beginning of the alphabet?
“Because they’ve got more pores, and more facial muscles.” {{Harvey}} was still laughing.
{{Sam}} waved {{ hisd(Sam) }} hand dismissively. “They already look like us, talk like us, how much more like us do you need them to be? It’s a little creepy, if you ask me.”
“Me too,” said {{Harvey}}. “Why do we need new ones when the old ones work perfectly fine?”
“Couldn’t agree with you more,” said {{Sam}}. {{Sam}} had liked {{Harvey}} since they first met, not long after {{Sam}} had met {{Rachel}}. Because {{Harvey}} worked in the maintenance department for the Company, {{ hisd(Harvey) }} shift started earlier. {{ He(Harvey) }} was usually in the cafeteria before the rush, when {{Sam}} liked to go.
“So, how are things?” asked {{Harvey}}. “You don’t look too happy.”
“Remember what happened exactly one year ago?” asked {{Sam}}.
“Oh, that’s right.” {{Harvey}}’s tone softened. “I’m sorry {{ budm(Sam) }}, I forgot.”
”As if I didn’t like Upgrade Day enough already,” said {{Sam}}.
“I don’t blame you,” said {{Harvey}}. There was an awkward silence, and {{Sam}} ate to occupy {{ himself(Sam) }}. “How are things at work?” asked {{Harvey}}. “That new kid {{Aaron}} still bugging you?”
{{Sam}} shrugged as {{ he(Sam) }} tore off a bite of bacon with {{ hisd(Sam) }} teeth. “Oh, {{ he(Aaron) }}’s alright I guess. {{ He(Aaron) }} stopped pestering me with all those questions, now that {{ he(Aaron) }}’s got the hang of the job. It’s my boss that’s bothering me more now than anything.” {{Sam}} had never been a complainer, but {{ he(Sam) }} found {{ himself(Sam) }} doing it more and more since {{Rachel}} was gone. {{ He(Sam) }} made a silent promise to {{ himself(Sam) }} to change that.
“What’s going on with your boss?”
“{{ He(Zach) }}’s a new {{ guy(Zach) }}. Not much older than {{Aaron}}. {{Zach}} is {{ hisd(Zach) }} name. {{ He(Zach) }} keeps getting on me about being more efficient. ‘Increase your calls per hour, {{Sam}}. Don’t dawdle on the phone, {{Sam}}.’ It drives me nuts.”
“Dawdle?” asked {{Harvey}}. “That doesn’t sound like a kid to me.”
“I think {{ he(Zach) }}’s trying to use vocabulary {{ he(Zach) }} thinks an old {{ man(Sam) }} like me would use.”
{{Harvey}} laughed, and despite {{ hisd(Sam) }} best efforts not to, so did {{Sam}}.
“You’d think they’d value someone with my experience.”
“I know,” said {{Harvey}}.
“I help the Company by making connections with people.”
“I know,” said {{Harvey}}.
“It’s not about efficiency, it’s about building relationships with our customers.”
“I hear you,” said {{Harvey}}. “You sound like an old {{ man(Sam) }}.”
“I am an old {{ man(Sam) }},” said {{Sam}}. {{ He(Sam) }} sighed. “Aw hell, {{Harvey}}. You think maybe it’s time for us to retire?”
“No way,” said {{Harvey}}. “I wouldn’t know what to do with myself if I didn’t work. And {{Harriet}}’s still working, so I’d just be at home getting into trouble.”
“What do you mean?”
“Well, after I blew up the oven {{ she(Harriet) }} doesn’t let me fix anything around the house anymore.”
{{Sam}} laughed. “That’s right. {{ She(Harriet) }} didn’t talk to you for a week.”
“Ruined {{ herd(Harriet) }} mother’s china.”
“What I don’t know is, how come you can fix every machine in this whole station, but you can’t fix your own stove?”
{{Harvey}} stared at {{Sam}} in mock anger. “What I want to know is, how come you can’t increase your calls per hour?”
{{Sam}} shook {{ hisd(Sam) }} head. “You know they’re trying to get us to talk to two customers at once? They want us to use one ear to talk to one customer, and the other to talk to another one.”
“Do they know you don’t have two mouths?”
“What’s that?” asked {{Sam}}. {{ He(Sam) }} stuck {{ hisd(Sam) }} finger in {{ hisd(Sam) }} ear and wiggled it around.
“Oh, come one. You still didn’t get your hearing checked out?”
“Nah,” said {{Sam}}. “It’s fine. It’s just my right ear, and it only goes out occasionally.”
“I’m telling you,” said {{Harvey}}. “That’s what doctors are for. Why don’t you go get it checked out? The Company’s doctors are just down the hall from you.”
“Don’t talk to me about doctors,” said {{Sam}}. {{ Hisd(Sam) }} voice grew angry.
{{Harvey}} raised {{ hisd(Harvey) }} hands. “Sorry, I know it’s a sensitive subject.”
“If {{Rachel}} hadn’t gone in for that checkup…”
“{{Sam}},” {{Harvey}}’s tone had softened again. “I know you think they caused it. But they didn’t. I swear. We’ve all gone to the doctor lots of times. You included. You really should go get that checked out. I had the same problem a few years ago, and now I can hear like a twenty-year old again.”
“Hey,” said {{Sam}}. “The only good thing about {{Rachel}} not being around is I don’t have anyone to nag me anymore.” {{Sam}} realized it was the first joke {{ he(Sam) }} told about {{Rachel}} being gone. {{ He(Sam) }} considered that progress.
{{Harvey}} laughed. “Fair enough. I’m just saying it ain’t that big a deal.”
“I know, I know. I’m just being lazy.”
“Speaking of lazy,” said {{Harvey}}, “We better get to work. This space station’s not going to run on its own.”
“Might as well,” said {{Sam}}.
They got up and took their trays to the trash, then wished each other a good day before heading in different directions. {{Sam}} walked down the corridor toward {{ hisd(Sam) }} apartment. As {{ he(Sam) }} passed {{ hisd(Sam) }} door, {{ he(Sam) }} had an odd feeling about work. Part of {{ him(Sam) }} wanted to just go back upstairs and call in sick, but {{ he(Sam) }} didn’t like the idea of sitting around the apartment all day, thinking of {{Rachel}}. Work would take {{ hisd(Sam) }} mind off things.
Since {{ he(Sam) }} was still early {{ he(Sam) }} decided to take the scenic route to work. There was a cafe with a long bank of windows looking out over earth. {{ He(Sam) }} thought about stopping and getting a coffee, but instead just paused for a moment to admire the view. It was almost identical to the one from {{ hisd(Sam) }} bedroom, but this one felt different, less personal, less {{ his(Sam) }}.
The sun was up, the windows now covered with protective tinting. {{ He(Sam) }} always liked seeing the sun right before the windows darkened. {{Sam}} had never been to Earth, never seen the sun without a thick sheet of glass between. The closest {{ he(Sam) }} ever got was that split second before the tinting shot through the window, that tiny spark on the rim of the world. The sun {{ he(Sam) }} saw now was dull and artificial-looking, the stars less bright.
{{Sam}} sighed and headed for work. Today’s going to be full of sighs, {{ he(Sam) }} thought. {{ He(Sam) }} cut away from the scenic route back to the more direct one. By now the hallways of the station had filled, and {{ he(Sam) }} was following the stream of people down the right side, watching the people going the opposite direction on {{ hisd(Sam) }} left. Sometimes {{ he(Sam) }} felt like the workers were just like cattle, moving in one direction because everyone else in front of them was doing the same. Today {{ he(Sam) }} felt that more than ever.
On {{ hisd(Sam) }} walk {{ he(Sam) }} caught snippets of conversation–mostly from younger people, and mostly about the B Android. Have you seen one yet? I think so, but I wasn’t sure. Oh, I could totally tell. They look so real! I know. I can’t wait to get one.
When {{Sam}} got to {{ hisd(Sam) }} desk, {{Aaron}} looked up at {{ him(Sam) }}. {{ Hisd(Aaron) }} desk was next to {{Sam}}'s. {{Aaron}} covered {{ hisd(Aaron) }} microphone and whispered, “Hey, {{Zach}} wants to see you.”
{{Sam}} pointed at {{ himself(Sam) }}. “Me?”
{{Aaron}} nodded and looked back at {{ hisd(Aaron) }} computer. “Yes ma’am,” {{ he(Aaron) }} said. “Ten percent more pores. It’s almost like human skin. Yes, you can get different color hairs.” {{Aaron}} looked at {{Sam}} and rolled {{ hisd(Aaron) }} eyes. {{Sam}} smiled, proud of how far the kid had come under {{ hisd(Sam) }} tutelage. “Yes, ma’am,” continued {{Aaron}}.
{{Sam}} sighed–there’s another sigh, {{ he(Sam) }} thought–and headed for {{Zach}}’s office. I should’ve stayed home. What’s it going to be about this time? Calls per hour? Efficient communication? Pushing the new products more? How can I push something I don’t even like?
{{Sam}} paused at the closed door. {{ He(Sam) }} took a deep breath and reached up to knock, but was startled when the door opened. First {{ he(Sam) }} saw {{Zach}}, then the {{ man(Sam) }} who opened the door. ‘Man’ was a bit of a stretch. {{ He(Sam) }} looked even younger than {{Aaron}}.
“{{Sam}}!” said {{Zach}}. “Just the {{ man(Sam) }} I wanted to see. {{Sam}}, meet {{Barry}}. {{ He(Barry) }} just started work with us today.”
{{Sam}} held out {{ hisd(Sam) }} hand and {{Barry}} shook it, squeezing a little too tightly. {{ He(Sam) }} had seen so many new hires, and wondered if {{ he(Sam) }} had ever been like them.
“Nice to meet you, {{Sam}}. I’m really looking forward to working for the Company.”
“Well, I’m sure you’ll enjoy it just fine,” said {{Sam}}.
{{Barry}} turned to {{Zach}}. “I’ll see you later. Thanks, {{Zach}}.” {{ He(Barry) }} turned back to {{Sam}} and smiled before walking out the door. {{Sam}} nodded.
“{{Sam}}, come on in,” said {{Zach}}.
“Should I sit down?”
“What? Oh, no. Don’t worry, this will only take a minute.”
“That’s right,” said {{Sam}}. “We wouldn’t want to be inefficient.” {{ He(Sam) }} knew {{ he(Sam) }} shouldn’t be sarcastic to {{ hisd(Sam) }} boss, but {{ he(Sam) }} couldn’t help {{ himself(Sam) }}.
“It’s about your physical,” said {{Zach}}, as if {{ he(Zach) }} hadn’t heard {{Sam}}.
“My physical?”
“Yes. It’s Company policy to have one every year. Now, I know you didn’t have one last year, and of course the Company understands why. But we really need you to take one this year.”
{{Sam}} gave another sigh. {{ He(Sam) }} wondered if {{ he(Sam) }} should start counting them. “{{Zach}}, I—”
“{{Sam}}, I know losing {{Rachel}} was tough. But you have to understand, that was a total coincidence. The Company has the best doctors in the world.”
“They have the only doctors in the world,” mumbled {{Sam}}.
“What was that?”
“Nothing,” said {{Sam}}. “I suppose you’re right. I’ll make an appointment today.”
{{Zach}} handed {{ him(Sam) }} a sheet of paper. “Already made one for you. They’re expecting you right now.”
“Right now?” The question came out louder than {{Sam}} wanted.
“Yup,” said {{Zach}}. {{ Hisd(Zach) }} smile seemed disingenuous, almost creepy to {{Sam}}.
{{Sam}} sighed. “Alright, I guess I’m due.” Without saying goodbye {{ he(Sam) }} turned and walked out, not caring if it was rude. {{ He(Sam) }} just wanted the physical to be over with.
The doctor’s office was a short walk from {{Zach}}’s. When {{Sam}} arrived, {{ he(Sam) }} smiled at the pretty young receptionist. {{ She(receptionist) }} smiled back. Well, that’s the first good thing to happen to me today, {{ he(Sam) }} thought.
“{{Sam}}?” {{ she(receptionist) }} said.
“Yes.”
“Just have a seat right there. The doctors will be with you in a moment.”
As {{ he(Sam) }} found a seat in the empty waiting room, {{Sam}}'s heart started beating faster. {{ Hisd(Sam) }} tongue felt thick and dry, and {{ he(Sam) }} looked for a water dispenser. There was none.
{{ He(Sam) }} thought {{ he(Sam) }} heard something, but {{ he(Sam) }} wasn’t sure what. Then {{ he(Sam) }} noticed the receptionist staring at {{ him(Sam) }}.
“Sorry, did you say something?” {{ he(Sam) }} asked.
{{ She(receptionist) }} smiled. “I said they’re ready for you.”
Already? I just sat down. {{Sam}} gripped the arms of {{ hisd(Sam) }} chair and stood up slowly. Not wanting to show the fear that was building inside {{ him(Sam) }}, {{ he(Sam) }} managed another smile and walked to the other end of the room.
There {{ he(Sam) }} paused, hand on the door. Come on, get ahold of yourself. It’s just a doctor’s visit, for Christ’s sake. {{ He(Sam) }} tried to suppress thoughts of {{Rachel}}, suppress the memory of the phone call {{ he(Sam) }} got a year ago telling {{ him(Sam) }} {{ she(Rachel) }} had suffered a cardiac arrest in the chair during {{ herd(Rachel) }} annual checkup. Even with access to equipment, the doctors couldn’t revive {{ her(Rachel) }}.
“It’s right through there,” said the receptionist. {{ Herd(receptionist) }} voice startled {{ him(Sam) }} so much {{ he(Sam) }} accidentally pushed the door open.
“Hi, {{Sam}}. Come on in.” There was a {{ man(Doctor1) }} in a white coat standing in the middle of a metal room. “Please, have a seat.”
{{Sam}} nodded and stretched {{ hisd(Sam) }} face into a false smile. With slow, cautious steps {{ he(Sam) }} moved toward the chair. “Doctor,” {{ he(Sam) }} finally managed to say.
“Please, make yourself comfortable.”
{{Sam}} sank into the chair. It was far more comfortable than {{ he(Sam) }} remembered. The armrests were cushioned, as was the footrest, and it reclined like {{ hisd(Sam) }} chair at home. That helped {{ him(Sam) }} relax a little. Then {{Sam}} looked at the doctor and saw {{ he(Doctor1) }} was about {{ hisd(Sam) }} own age, fit and lean but almost completely gray. That relaxed {{Sam}} even more.
The doctor spoke again. “I hope you don’t mind if we have another doctor in the room. {{ He(Doctor2) }}’s been training with me for the past year.”
Only then did {{Sam}} notice a third person in the room. {{ He(Doctor2) }} was dressed the same as the other doctor, but looked much younger. {{Sam}} looked back at the older one, and before {{ he(Sam) }} could stop the thought it escaped {{ hisd(Sam) }} lips. “{{ He(Doctor2) }} looks like a kid.”
Realizing {{ hisd(Sam) }} rudeness, {{Sam}} looked back at the younger doctor. “Sorry,” {{ he(Sam) }} waved {{ hisd(Sam) }} hand. “I know you’re qualified. You just make me feel old.”
“That’s okay,” the younger one smiled. “I get that all the time.”
The older doctor laughed. “I know what you mean, {{Sam}}. My doctor’s younger than I am, too. It took me a while to get used to that.” {{ He(Doctor1) }} nodded to the younger doctor, who started asking questions. “So {{Sam}}, any concerns you have? Any chronic pains, trouble breathing, shortness of breath, chest pains or anything like that?”
“Well,” said {{Sam}}. {{ He(Sam) }} paused, wondering whether to continue. If {{ hisd(Sam) }} hearing was going, {{ he(Sam) }} didn’t want to lose {{ hisd(Sam) }} job and be forced into retirement. This doctor seemed nice, though, a {{ man(Doctor2) }} {{ he(Sam) }} could trust. At least the older one did. “I do have trouble hearing every once in a while.”
“Really?” The doctors looked at each other, and it made {{Sam}} a little more nervous. “In both ears?”
{{ He(Sam) }} shook {{ hisd(Sam) }} head. “Just the right one.” {{ He(Sam) }} tapped it.
“Alright, we can run a scan on that. Anything else?”
{{Sam}} thought of telling them about the occasional loss of feeling in two fingers of {{ hisd(Sam) }} left hand, the sore joints in the morning, the occasional lack of energy, a popping sound when {{ he(Sam) }} moved {{ hisd(Sam) }} jaw, the creaking when {{ he(Sam) }} bent down. But {{ he(Sam) }} decided to just see what happened with {{ hisd(Sam) }} hearing. “Nope. That’s it. Fit as a fiddle.”
“Alright then,” said the older doctor. “We’ll see if we can take care of you. Now you just lie back into that chair and we’ll run a full scan.”
“How does this work?” asked {{Sam}}. “This chair seems different than the one before.”
The two doctors looked at each other. “How long has it been since your last physical?” asked the younger doctor.
“I missed mine last year. So two years, I guess.”
“Oh, then yes. This is a newer model.”
“Well, it’s a lot comfier than the old one,” said {{Sam}}.
The younger one continued. “It’s not just that. The scanning capabilities are much better. And we’re supposed to get and even newer, better one next month.”
{{Sam}} snorted. “Upgrade,” {{ he(Sam) }} said.
“That’s right. Now just lie back and relax.”
“I know Doc,” {{Sam}} chided. “It’s not my first visit to the doctor.”
The young doctor smiled. “Of course.”
{{Sam}} watched as the younger doctor followed the older one into a room with a large window that looked into the examining room. “Close the door,” said the older one, but apparently the younger didn’t hear because {{ he(Doctor2) }} left it open.
“See, there’s nothing wrong with my hearing now,” {{Sam}} mumbled to {{ himself(Sam) }}. The glass was tinted, but {{ he(Sam) }} could still see them moving behind it.
“Just look up at the ceiling, {{Sam}}.” The older doctor’s voice came through a speaker somewhere in the room. “The straps are going to come on now. They’re just there to keep you still for the scan.”
{{Sam}} let {{ hisd(Sam) }} body settle into the chair. Before {{Rachel}} had died, {{ he(Sam) }} actually enjoyed going to the doctor, the sense of security a checkup gave {{ him(Sam) }}. {{ He(Sam) }} even liked the snug examination chair, and as the straps wrapped around {{ hisd(Sam) }} legs, arms, torso and head, that feeling began to wash over {{ him(Sam) }} again.
The lights dimmed, and {{Sam}} heard the low hum of the scanner as it moved up and down {{ hisd(Sam) }} body. The sound was soothing, and {{Sam}} fell into a light sleep. Only the loud click as the scanner locked back into place snapped {{Sam}} awake.
{{ Hisd(Sam) }} room was silent and still dark, and for a while the only thing coming out of the other room was a small wedge of light from the doorway. Since the straps were still on {{Sam}} couldn’t move {{ hisd(Sam) }} head, but {{ he(Sam) }} saw it out of the corner of {{ hisd(Sam) }} eye.
“Here we go.” The voice of the older doctor came out of the cracked door. “It’s just as I thought. Pretty extensive degradation.”
That alarmed {{Sam}}. Degradation of what?
“{{ He(Sam) }}’s got some burned circuitry in {{ hisd(Sam) }} right auditory processor,” the doctor continued, “and some fraying wires running down the left arm.”
Auditory processor? Wires? What the hell are they talking about?
“And look at the rust build up in all those joints,” said the younger. “I’m surprised we didn’t hear {{ him(Sam) }} squeak walking down the hall.” They both laughed.
{{Sam}}'s heart was thumping, {{ hisd(Sam) }} breathing short and quick. They must be confused. Why do they keep using mechanical words to describe me? Are they talking about something else? {{ He(Sam) }} strained against the straps, but they wouldn’t budge.
“It’s a shame,” said the older doctor. “The S model was a great one when it came out, but they’re all starting to fall apart these days.”
S model? What the hell is {{ he(Sam) }} talking about? “Doctor? Doctor! DOCTOR!” {{ He(Sam) }} thought {{ he(Sam) }} was yelling at the top of {{ hisd(Sam) }} lungs, but no sound came out. That only made {{ him(Sam) }} try harder.
“So, what should we do with {{ him(Sam) }}?” asked the younger.
“Send {{ him(Sam) }} to the junk shop, see if they can use some of {{ hisd(Sam) }} parts.”
Junk shop? Parts? {{Sam}} was frantic now. {{ He(Sam) }} twisted and contorted {{ hisd(Sam) }} body, but it felt like it was glued to the chair. Something other than the straps was holding {{ him(Sam) }} there. Then the chair started moving forward, and the wall in front of {{ him(Sam) }} opened up into a gaping black rectangle.
{{Sam}} struggled but could not move. {{ He(Sam) }} yelled but made no sound.
“Have you seen the new {{Barry}} yet?” asked the younger doctor.
“No, I upgraded last year with the {{Aaron}}. I try to go every other year, otherwise it gets too expensive.”
“I hear you,” said the younger. “Still, they’re just so much better every year. These new ones are so lifelike.”
“I know,” said the older. “That’s why I turned off this {{Sam}}'s voice box. The programmers make them sound so real, even the screams. It’s a little creepy.”
{{Sam}}’s heart was pounding, {{ hisd(Sam) }} throat raw as {{ he(perSamson) }} was swallowed by the blackness. The last thing {{ he(Sam) }} heard was the younger doctor’s voice.
“It’s almost like they really feel something.”
