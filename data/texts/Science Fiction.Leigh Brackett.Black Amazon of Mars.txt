<h1>Black Amazon of Mars</h1>

<h2>One</h2>
Through all the long cold hours of the Norland night the Martian had not moved nor spoken. At dusk of the day before {{Eric John}} Stark had brought {{ him(Camar) }} into the ruined tower and laid {{ him(Camar) }} down, wrapped in blankets, on the snow. {{ He(Eric John) }} had built a fire of dead brush, and since then the two had waited, alone in the vast wasteland that girdles the polar cap of Mars.
Now, just before dawn, {{Camar}} the Martian spoke.
"Stark."
"Yes?"
"I am dying."
"Yes."
"I will not reach Kushat."
"No."
{{Camar}} nodded. {{ He(Camar) }} was silent again.
The wind howled down from the northern ice, and the broken walls rose up against it, brooding, gigantic, roofless now but so huge and sprawling that they seemed less like walls than cliffs of ebon stone. Stark would not have gone near them but for {{Camar}}. They were wrong, somehow, with a taint of forgotten evil still about them.
The big Earth{{ man(Eric John) }} glanced at {{Camar}}, and {{ hisd(Eric John) }} face was sad. "A person likes to die in their own place," {{ he(Eric John) }} said abruptly. "I am sorry."
"The {{ Lord(Deity) }} of Silence is a great personage," {{Camar}} answered. "He does not mind the meeting place. No. It was not for that I came back into the Norlands."
{{ He(Camar) }} was shaken by an agony that was not of the body. "And I shall not reach Kushat!"
Stark spoke quietly, using the courtly High Martian almost as fluently as {{Camar}}.
"I have known that there was a burden heavier than death upon my {{ brother(Camar) }}'s soul."
{{ He(Eric John) }} leaned over, placing one large hand on the Martian's shoulder. "My {{ brother(Camar) }} has given {{ hisd(Camar) }} life for mine. Therefore, I will take {{ hisd(Camar) }} burden upon myself, if I can."
{{ He(Eric John) }} did not want {{Camar}}'s burden, whatever it might be. But the Martian had fought beside {{ him(Eric John) }} through a long guerilla campaign among the harried tribes of the nearer moon. {{ He(Camar) }} was a good {{ man(Camar) }} of {{ hisd(Camar) }} hands, and in the end had taken the bullet that was meant for Stark, knowing quite well what {{ he(Camar) }} was doing. They were friends.
That was why Stark had brought {{Camar}} into the bleak north country, trying to reach the city of {{ hisd(Camar) }} birth. The Martian was driven by some secret demon. {{ He(Camar) }} was afraid to die before {{ he(Camar) }} reached Kushat.
And now {{ he(Camar) }} had no choice.
"I have sinned, Stark. I have stolen a holy thing. You're an outlander, you would not know of Ban Cruach, and the talisman that {{ he(Ban) }} left when {{ he(Ban) }} went away forever beyond the Gates of Death."
{{Camar}} flung aside the blankets and sat up, {{ hisd(Camar) }} voice gaining a febrile strength.
"I was born and bred in the Thieves' Quarter under the Wall. I was proud of my skill. And the talisman was a challenge. It was a treasured thing—so treasured that hardly person has touched it since the days of Ban Cruach who made it. And that was in the days when people still had the lustre on them, before they forgot that they were gods.
"'Guard well the Gates of Death,' {{ he(Camar) }} said, 'that is the city's trust. And keep the talisman always, for the day may come when you will need its strength. Who holds Kushat holds Mars—and the talisman will keep the city safe.'
"I was a thief, and proud. And I stole the talisman."
{{ Hisd(Camar) }} hands went to {{ hisd(Camar) }} girdle, a belt of worn leather with a boss of battered steel. But {{ hisd(Camar) }} fingers were already numb.
"Take it, Stark. Open the boss—there, on the side, where the beast's head is carved...."
Stark took the belt from {{Camar}} and found the hidden spring. The rounded top of the boss came free. Inside it was something wrapped in a scrap of silk.
"I had to leave Kushat," {{Camar}} whispered. "I could never go back. But it was enough—to have taken that."
{{ He(Camar) }} watched, shaken between awe and pride and remorse, as Stark unwrapped the bit of silk.
Stark had discounted most of {{Camar}}'s talk as superstition, but even so {{ he(Eric John) }} had expected something more spectacular than the object {{ he(Eric John) }} held in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} palm.
It was a lens, some four inches across—man-made, and made with great skill, but still only a bit of crystal. Turning it about, Stark saw that it was not a simple lens, but an intricate interlocking of many facets. Incredibly complicated, hypnotic if one looked at it too long.
"What is its use?" {{ he(Eric John) }} asked of {{Camar}}.
"We are as children. We have forgotten. But there is a legend, a belief—that Ban Cruach {{ himself(Ban) }} made the talisman as a sign that {{ he(Ban) }} would not forget us, and would come back when Kushat is threatened. Back through the Gates of Death, to teach us again the power that was {{ hisd(Ban) }}!"
"I do not understand," said Stark. "What are the Gates of Death?"
{{Camar}} answered, "It is a pass that opens into the black mountains beyond Kushat. The city stands guard before it—why, no man or woman remembers, except that it is a great trust."
{{ Hisd(Camar) }} gaze feasted on the talisman.
Stark said, "You wish me to take this to Kushat?"
"Yes. Yes! And yet...." {{Camar}} looked at Stark, {{ hisd(Camar) }} eyes filling suddenly with tears. "No. The North is not used to strangers. With me, you might have been safe. But alone.... No, Stark. You have risked too much already. Go back, out of the Norlands, while you can."
{{ He(Camar) }} lay back on the blankets. Stark saw that a bluish pallor had come into the hollows of {{ hisd(Camar) }} cheeks.
"{{Camar}}," {{ he(Eric John) }} said. And again, "{{Camar}}!"
"Yes?"
"Go in peace, {{Camar}}. I will take the talisman to Kushat."
The Martian sighed, and smiled, and Stark was glad that {{ he(Eric John) }} had made the promise.
"The riders of Mekh are wolves," said {{Camar}} suddenly. "They hunt these gorges. Look out for them."
"I will."
Stark's knowledge of the geography of this part of Mars was vague indeed, but {{ he(Eric John) }} knew that the mountain valleys of Mekh lay ahead and to the north, between {{ him(Eric John) }} and Kushat. {{Camar}} had told {{ him(Eric John) }} of these upland warriors. {{ He(Eric John) }} was willing to heed the warning.
{{Camar}} had done with talking. Stark knew that {{ he(Eric John) }} had not long to wait. The wind spoke with the voice of a great organ. The moons had set and it was very dark outside the tower, except for the white glimmering of the snow. Stark looked up at the brooding walls, and shivered. There was a smell of death already in the air.
To keep from thinking, {{ he(Eric John) }} bent closer to the fire, studying the lens. There were scratches on the bezel, as though it had been held sometime in a clamp, or setting, like a jewel. An ornament, probably, worn as a badge of rank. Strange ornament for a barbarian {{ king(Ban) }}, in the dawn of Mars. The firelight made tiny dancing sparks in the endless inner facets. Quite suddenly, {{ he(Eric John) }} had a curious feeling that the thing was alive.
A pang of primitive and unreasoning fear shot through {{ him(Eric John) }}, and {{ he(Eric John) }} fought it down. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} vision was beginning to blur, and {{ he(Eric John) }} shut {{ hisd(Eric John) }} eyes, and in the darkness it seemed to {{ him(Eric John) }} that {{ he(Eric John) }} could see and hear....
{{ He(Eric John) }} started up, shaken now with an eerie terror, and raised {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hand to hurl the talisman away. But the part of {{ him(Eric John) }} that had learned with much pain and effort to be civilized made {{ him(Eric John) }} stop, and think.
{{ He(Eric John) }} sat down again. An instrument of hypnosis? Possibly. And yet that fleeting touch of sight and sound had not been {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own, out of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own memories.
{{ He(Eric John) }} was tempted now, fascinated, like a child that plays with fire. The talisman had been worn somehow. Where? On the breast? On the brow?
{{ He(Eric John) }} tried the first, with no result. Then {{ he(Eric John) }} touched the flat surface of the lens to {{ hisd(Eric John) }} forehead.
The great tower of stone rose up monstrous to the sky. It was whole, and there were pallid lights within that stirred and flickered, and it was crowned with a shimmering darkness.
{{ He(Eric John) }} lay outside the tower, on {{ hisd(Eric John) }} belly, and {{ he(Eric John) }} was filled with fear and a great anger, and a loathing such as turns the bones to water. There was no snow. There was ice everywhere, rising to half the tower's height, sheathing the ground.
Ice. Cold and clear and beautiful—and deadly.
{{ He(Eric John) }} moved. {{ He(Eric John) }} glided snakelike, with infinite caution, over the smooth surface. The tower was gone, and far below {{ him(Eric John) }} was a city. {{ He(Eric John) }} saw the temples and the palaces, the glittering lovely city beneath {{ him(Eric John) }} in the ice, blurred and fairylike and strange, a dream half glimpsed through crystal.
{{ He(Eric John) }} saw the Ones that lived there, moving slowly through the streets. {{ He(Eric John) }} could not see them clearly, only the vague shining of their bodies, and {{ he(Eric John) }} was glad.
{{ He(Eric John) }} hated them, with a hatred that conquered even {{ hisd(Eric John) }} fear, which was great indeed.
{{ He(Eric John) }} was not {{Eric John}} Stark. {{ He(Eric John) }} was Ban Cruach.
The tower and the city vanished, swept away on a reeling tide.
{{ He(Eric John) }} stood beneath a scarp of black rock, notched with a single pass. The cliffs hung over {{ him(Eric John) }}, leaning out their vast bulk as though to crush {{ him(Eric John) }}, and the narrow mouth of the pass was full of evil laughter where the wind went by.
{{ He(Eric John) }} began to walk forward, into the pass. {{ He(Eric John) }} was quite alone.
The light was dim and strange at the bottom of that cleft. Little veils of mist crept and clung between the ice and the rock, thickened, became more dense as {{ he(Eric John) }} went farther and farther into the pass. {{ He(Eric John) }} could not see, and the wind spoke with many tongues, piping in the crevices of the cliffs.
All at once there was a shadow in the mist before {{ him(Eric John) }}, a dim gigantic shape that moved toward {{ him(Eric John) }}, and {{ he(Eric John) }} knew that {{ he(Eric John) }} looked at death. {{ He(Eric John) }} cried out....
It was Stark who yelled in blind atavistic fear, and the echo of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own cry brought {{ him(Eric John) }} up standing, shaking in every limb. {{ He(Eric John) }} had dropped the talisman. It lay gleaming in the snow at {{ hisd(Eric John) }} feet, and the alien memories were gone—and {{Camar}} was dead.
After a time {{ he(Eric John) }} crouched down, breathing harshly. {{ He(Eric John) }} did not want to touch the lens again. The part of {{ him(Eric John) }} that had learned to fear strange gods and evil spirits with every step {{ he(Eric John) }} took, the primitive aboriginal that lay so close under the surface of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} mind, warned {{ him(Eric John) }} to leave it, to run away, to desert this place of death and ruined stone.
{{ He(Eric John) }} forced {{ himself(Eric John) }} to take it up. {{ He(Eric John) }} did not look at it. {{ He(Eric John) }} wrapped it in the bit of silk and replaced it inside the iron boss, and clasped the belt around {{ hisd(Eric John) }} waist. Then {{ he(Eric John) }} found the small flask that lay with {{ hisd(Eric John) }} gear beside the fire and took a long pull, and tried to think rationally of the thing that had happened.
Memories. Not {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own, but the memories of Ban Cruach, a million years ago in the morning of a world. Memories of hate, a secret war against unhuman beings that dwelt in crystal cities cut in the living ice, and used these ruined towers for some dark purpose of their own.
Was that the meaning of the talisman, the power that lay within it? Had Ban Cruach, by some elder and forgotten science, imprisoned the echoes of {{ hisd(Ban) }} own mind in the crystal?
Why? Perhaps as a warning, as a reminder of ageless, alien danger beyond the Gates of Death?
Suddenly one of the beasts tethered outside the ruined tower started up from its sleep with a hissing snarl.
Instantly Stark became motionless.
They came silently on their padded feet, the rangy mountain brutes moving daintily through the sprawling ruin. Their riders too were silent—tall {{ men(Thord) }} with fierce eyes and russet hair, wearing leather coats and carrying each a long, straight spear.
There were a score of them around the tower in the windy gloom. Stark did not bother to draw {{ hisd(Eric John) }} gun. {{ He(Eric John) }} had learned very young the difference between courage and idiocy.
{{ He(Eric John) }} walked out toward them, slowly lest one of them be startled into spearing {{ him(Eric John) }}, yet not slowly enough to denote fear. And {{ he(Eric John) }} held up {{ hisd(Eric John) }} right hand and gave them greeting.
They did not answer {{ him(Eric John) }}. They sat their restive mounts and stared at {{ him(Eric John) }}, and Stark knew that {{Camar}} had spoken the truth. These were the riders of Mekh, and they were wolves.
II
Stark waited, until they should tire of their own silence.
Finally one demanded, "Of what country are you?"
{{ He(Eric John) }} answered, "I am called N'Chaka, the {{ Man(Eric John) }}-Without-a-Tribe."
It was the name they had given {{ him(Eric John) }}, the half-human aboriginals who had raised {{ him(Eric John) }} in the blaze and thunder and bitter frosts of Mercury.
"A stranger," said the leader, and smiled. {{ He(Thord) }} pointed at the dead {{Camar}} and asked, "Did you slay {{ him(Camar) }}?"
"{{ He(Camar) }} was my friend," said Stark, "I was bringing {{ him(Camar) }} home to die."
Two riders dismounted to inspect the body. One called up to the leader, "{{ He(Camar) }} was from Kushat, if I know the breed, {{Thord}}! And {{ he(Camar) }} has not been robbed." {{ He(Thord) }} proceeded to take care of that detail {{ himself(Thord) }}.
"A stranger," repeated the leader, {{Thord}}. "Bound for Kushat, with a {{ man(Camar) }} of Kushat. Well. I think you will come with us, stranger."
Stark shrugged. And with the long spears pricking {{ him(Eric John) }}, {{ he(Eric John) }} did not resist when the tall {{Thord}} plundered {{ him(Eric John) }} of all {{ he(Eric John) }} owned except {{ hisd(Eric John) }} clothes—and {{Camar}}'s belt, which was not worth the stealing. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} gun {{Thord}} flung contemptuously away.
One of the {{ men(Thord) }} brought Stark's beast and {{Camar}}'s from where they were tethered, and the Earth{{ man(Eric John) }} mounted—as usual, over the violent protest of the creature, which did not like the smell of {{ him(Eric John) }}. They moved out from under the shelter of the walls, into the full fury of the wind.
For the rest of that night, and through the next day and the night that followed it they rode eastward, stopping only to rest the beasts and chew on their rations of jerked meat.
To Stark, riding a prisoner, it came with full force that this was the North country, half a world away from the Mars of spaceships and commerce and visitors from other planets. The future had never touched these wild mountains and barren plains. The past held pride enough.
To the north, the horizon showed a strange and ghostly glimmer where the barrier wall of the polar pack reared up, gigantic against the sky. The wind blew, down from the ice, through the mountain gorges, across the plains, never ceasing. And here and there the cryptic towers rose, broken monoliths of stone. Stark remembered the vision of the talisman, the huge structure crowned with eerie darkness. {{ He(Eric John) }} looked upon the ruins with loathing and curiosity. The {{ men(Thord) }} of Mekh could tell {{ him(Eric John) }} nothing.
{{Thord}} did not tell Stark where they were taking {{ him(Eric John) }}, and Stark did not ask. It would have been an admission of fear.
In mid-afternoon of the second day they came to a lip of rock where the snow was swept clean, and below it was a sheer drop into a narrow valley. Looking down, Stark saw that on the floor of the valley, up and down as far as {{ he(Eric John) }} could see, were people and beasts and shelters of hide and brush, and fires burning. By the hundreds, by the several thousand, they camped under the cliffs, and their voices rose up on the thin air in a vast deep murmur that was deafening after the silence of the plains.
A war party, gathered now, before the thaw. Stark smiled. {{ He(Eric John) }} became curious to meet the leader of this army.
They found their way single file along a winding track that dropped down the cliff face. The wind stopped abruptly, cut off by the valley walls. They came in among the shelters of the camp.
Here the snow was churned and soiled and melted to slush by the fires. There were no {{ women-opp(Thord) }}folk in the camp, no sign of the usual cheerful rabble that follows a barbarian army. There were only martian {{ men(Thorn) }}—hill{{ men(Thord) }} and warriors all, tough-handed killers with no thought but battle.
They came out of their holes to shout at {{Thord}} and {{ hisd(Thord) }} {{ men(Thord) }}, and stare at the stranger. {{Thord}} was flushed and jovial with importance.
"I have no time for you," {{ he(Thord) }} shouted back. "I go to speak with the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}."
Stark rode impassively, a dark giant with a face of stone. From time to time {{ he(Eric John) }} made {{ hisd(Eric John) }} beast curvet, and laughed at {{ himself(Eric John) }} inwardly for doing it.
They came at length to a shelter larger than the others, but built exactly the same and no more comfortable. A spear was thrust into the snow beside the entrance, and from it hung a black pennant with a single bar of silver across it, like lightning in a night sky. Beside it was a shield with the same device. There were no guards.
{{Thord}} dismounted, bidding Stark to do the same. {{ He(Thord) }} hammered on the shield with the hilt of {{ hisd(Thord) }} sword, announcing {{ himself(Thord) }}.
"{{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}! It is {{Thord}}—with a captive."
A voice, toneless and strangely muffled, spoke from within.
"Enter, {{Thord}}."
{{Thord}} pushed aside the hide curtain and went in, with Stark at {{ hisd(Thord) }} heels.
The dim daylight did not penetrate the interior. Cressets burned, giving off a flickering brilliance and a smell of strong oil. The floor of packed snow was carpeted with furs, much worn. Otherwise there was no adornment, and no furniture but a chair and a table, both dark with age and use, and a pallet of skins in one shadowy corner with what seemed to be a heap of rags upon it.
In the chair sat a {{ man(Thord) }}.
{{ He(Thord) }} seemed very tall, in the shaking light of the cressets. From neck to thigh {{ hisd(Thord) }} lean body was cased in black link mail, and under that a tunic of leather, dyed black. Across {{ hisd(Thord) }} knees {{ he(Thord) }} held a sable axe, a great thing made for the shearing of skulls, and {{ hisd(Thord) }} hands lay upon it gently, as though it were a toy {{ he(Thord) }} loved.
{{ Hisd(Thord) }} head and face were covered by a thing that Stark had seen before only in very old paintings—the ancient war-mask of the inland {{King(Thord) }}s of Mars. Wrought of black and gleaming steel, it presented an unhuman visage of slitted eyeholes and a barred slot for breathing. Behind, it sprang out in a thin, soaring sweep, like a dark wing edge-on in flight.
The intent, expressionless scrutiny of that mask was bent, not upon {{Thord}}, but upon {{Eric John}} Stark.
The hollow voice spoke again, from behind the mask. "Well?"
"We were hunting in the gorges to the south," said {{Thord}}. "We saw a fire...." {{ He(Thord) }} told the story, of how they had found the stranger and the body of the {{ man(Camar) }} from Kushat.
"Kushat!" said the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} softly. "Ah! And why, stranger, were you going to Kushat?"
"My name is Stark. {{Eric John}} Stark, Earth{{ man(Eric John) }}, out of Mercury." {{ He(Eric John) }} was tired of being called stranger. Quite suddenly, {{ he(Eric John) }} was tired of the whole business.
"Why should I not go to Kushat? Is it against some law, that a man or woman may not go there in peace without being hounded all over the Norlands? And why do the people of Mekh make it their business? They have nothing to do with the city."
{{Thord}} held {{ hisd(Thord) }} breath, watching with delighted anticipation.
The hands of the {{ man(Thord) }} in armor caressed the axe. They were slender hands, smooth and sinewy—small hands, it seemed, for such a weapon.
"We make what we will our business, {{Eric John}} Stark." {{ He(Thord) }} spoke with a peculiar gentleness. "I have asked you. Why were you going to Kushat?"
"Because," Stark answered with equal restraint, "my comrade wanted to go home to die."
"It seems a long, hard journey, just for dying." The black helm bent forward, in an attitude of thought. "Only the condemned or banished leave their cities, or their clans. Why did your comrade flee Kushat?"
A voice spoke suddenly from out of the heap of rags that lay on the pallet in the shadows of the corner. A {{ man(Otar) }}'s voice, deep and husky, with the harsh quaver of age or madness in it.
"Three others beside myself have fled Kushat, over the years that matter. One died in the spring floods. One was caught in the moving ice of winter. One lived. A thief named {{Camar}}, who stole a certain talisman."
Stark said, "My comrade was called Greshi." The leather belt weighed heavy about {{ him(Eric John) }}, and the iron boss seemed hot against {{ hisd(Eric John) }} belly. {{ He(Eric John) }} was beginning, now, to be afraid.
The {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} spoke, ignoring Stark. "It was the sacred talisman of Kushat. Without it, the city is like a {{ man(Thord) }} without a soul."
As the Veil of Tanit was to Carthage, Stark thought, and reflected on the fate of that city after the Veil was stolen.
"The nobles were afraid of their own people," the {{ man(Thord) }} in armor said. "They did not dare to tell that it was gone. But we know."
"And," said Stark, "you will attack Kushat before the thaw, when they least expect you."
"You have a sharp mind, stranger. Yes. But the great wall will be hard to carry, even so. If I came, bearing in my hands the talisman of Ban Cruach...."
{{ He(Thord) }} did not finish, but turned instead to {{Thord}}. "When you plundered the dead {{ man(Camar) }}'s body, what did you find?"
"Nothing, {{ Lord(Thord) }}. A few coins, a knife, hardly worth the taking."
"And you, {{Eric John}} Stark. What did you take from the body?"
With perfect truth {{ he(Eric John) }} answered, "Nothing."
"{{Thord}}," said the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}, "search {{ him(Eric John) }}."
{{Thord}} came smiling up to Stark and ripped {{ hisd(Eric John) }} jacket open.
With uncanny swiftness, the Earth{{ man(Eric John) }} moved. The edge of one broad hand took {{Thord}} under the ear, and before the {{ man(Thord) }}'s knees had time to sag Stark had caught {{ hisd(Thord) }} arm. {{ He(Eric John) }} turned, crouching forward, and pitched {{Thord}} headlong through the door flap.
{{ He(Eric John) }} straightened and turned again. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} eyes held a feral glint. "The {{ man(Thord) }} has robbed me once," {{ he(Eric John) }} said. "It is enough."
{{ He(Eric John) }} heard {{Thord}}'s {{ men(Thord) }} coming. Three of them tried to jam through the entrance at once, and {{ he(Eric John) }} sprang at them. {{ He(Eric John) }} made no sound. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} fists did the talking for {{ him(Eric John) }}, and then {{ hisd(Eric John) }} feet, as {{ he(Eric John) }} kicked the stunned barbarians back upon their leader.
"Now," {{ he(Eric John) }} said to the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}, "will we talk as {{ man(Thord) }} to {{man(Eric John) }}?"
The {{ man(Thord) }} in armor laughed, a sound of pure enjoyment. It seemed that the gaze behind the mask studied Stark's savage face, and then lifted to greet the sullen {{Thord}} who came back into the shelter, {{ hisd(Thord) }} cheeks flushed crimson with rage.
"Go," said the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}. "The stranger and I will talk."
"But {{ Lord(Thord) }}," {{ he(Thord) }} protested, glaring at Stark, "it is not safe...."
"My dark {{ mistress-opp(Thord) }} looks after my safety," said {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}, stroking the axe across {{ hisd(Thord) }} knees. "Go."
{{Thord}} went.
The {{ man(Thord) }} in armor was silent then, the blind mask turned to Stark, who met that eyeless gaze and was silent also. And the bundle of rags in the shadows straightened slowly and became a tall old {{ man(Otar) }} with rusty hair and {{ beard(Otar) }}, through which peered craggy juts of bone and two bright, small points of fire, as though some wicked flame burned within {{ him(Otar) }}.
{{ He(Otar) }} shuffled over and crouched at the feet of the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}, watching the Earth{{ man(Eric John) }}. And the {{ man(Thord) }} in armor leaned forward.
"I will tell you something, {{Eric John}} Stark. I am a bastard {{ son(Thord) }}, but I come of the blood of kings. My name and rank I must make with my own hands. But I will set them high, and my name will ring in the Norlands!
"I will take Kushat. Who holds Kushat, holds Mars—and the power and the riches that lie beyond the Gates of Death!"
"I have seen them," said the old {{ man(Otar) }}, and {{ hisd(Otar) }} eyes blazed. "I have seen Ban Cruach the mighty. I have seen the temples and the palaces glitter in the ice. I have seen Them, the shining ones. Oh, I have seen them, the beautiful, hideous ones!"
{{ He(Thord) }} glanced sidelong at Stark, very cunning. "That is why {{Otar}} is mad, stranger. {{ He(Otar) }} has seen."
A chill swept Stark. {{ He(Eric John) }} too had seen, not with {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own eyes but with the mind and memories of Ban Cruach, of a million years ago.
Then it had been no illusion, the fantastic vision opened to {{ him(Eric John) }} by the talisman now hidden in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} belt! If this old madman had seen....
"What beings lurk beyond the Gates of Death I do not know," said {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}. "But my dark {{ mistress-opp(Thord) }} will test their strength—and I think my red wolves will hunt them down, once they get a smell of plunder."
"The beautiful, terrible ones," whispered {{Otar}}. "And oh, the temples and the palaces, and the great towers of stone!"
"Ride with me, Stark," said the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} abruptly. "Yield up the talisman, and be the shield at my back. I have offered no other that honor."
Stark asked slowly, "Why do you choose me?"
"We are of one blood, Stark, though we be strangers."
The Earth{{ man(Eric John) }}'s cold eyes narrowed. "What would your red wolves say to that? And what would {{Otar}} say? Look at {{ him(Otar) }}, already stiff with jealousy, and fear lest I answer, 'Yes'."
"I do not think you would be afraid of either of them."
"On the contrary," said Stark, "I am a prudent {{ man(Eric John) }}." {{ He(Eric John) }} paused. "There is one other thing. I will bargain with no man or woman until I have looked into their eyes. Take off your helm, {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}—and then perhaps we will talk!"
{{Otar}}'s breath made a snakelike hissing between {{ hisd(Otar) }} toothless gums, and the hands of the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} tightened on the haft of the axe.
"No!" {{ he(Thord) }} whispered. "That I can never do."
{{Otar}} rose to {{ hisd(Otar) }} feet, and for the first time Stark felt the full strength that lay in this strange old {{ man(Otar) }}.
"Would you look upon the face of destruction?" {{ he(Otar) }} thundered. "Do you ask for death? Do you think a thing is hidden behind a mask of steel without a reason, that you demand to see it?"
{{ He(Otar) }} turned. "My {{ Lord(Thord) }}," {{ he(Otar) }} said. "By tomorrow the last of the clans will have joined us. After that, we must march. Give this Earth{{ man(Eric John) }} to {{Thord}}, for the time that remains—and you will have the talisman."
The blank, blind mask was unmoving, turned toward Stark, and the Earth{{ man(Eric John) }} thought that from behind it came a faint sound that might have been a sigh.
Then....
"{{Thord}}!" cried the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}, and lifted up the axe.
III
The flames leaped high from the fire in the windless gorge. {{ Men(Thord) }} sat around it in a great circle, the wild riders out of the mountain valleys of Mekh. They sat with the curbed and shivering eagerness of wolves around a dying quarry. Now and again their white teeth showed in a kind of silent laughter, and their eyes watched.
"{{ He(Eric John) }} is strong," they whispered, one to the other. "{{ He(Eric John) }} will live the night out, surely!"
On an outcrop of rock sat the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}, wrapped in a black cloak, holding the great axe in the crook of {{ hisd(Thord) }} arm. Beside {{ him(Thord) }}, {{Otar}} huddled in the snow.
Close by, the long spears had been driven deep and lashed together to make a scaffolding, and upon this frame was hung a {{ man(Eric John) }}. A big {{ man(Eric John) }}, iron-muscled and very lean, the bulk of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} shoulders filling the space between the bending shafts. {{Eric John}} Stark of Earth, out of Mercury.
{{ He(Eric John) }} had already been scourged without mercy. {{ He(Eric John) }} sagged of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own weight between the spears, breathing in harsh sobs, and the trampled snow around {{ him(Eric John) }} was spotted red.
{{Thord}} was wielding the lash. {{ He(Thord) }} had stripped off {{ hisd(Thord) }} own coat, and {{ hisd(Thord) }} body glistened with sweat in spite of the cold. {{ He(Thord) }} cut {{ hisd(Thord) }} victim with great care, making the long lash sing and crack. {{ He(Thord) }} was proud of {{ hisd(Thord) }} skill.
Stark did not cry out.
Presently {{Thord}} stepped back, panting, and looked at the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}. And the black helm nodded.
{{Thord}} dropped the whip. {{ He(Thord) }} went up to the big dark {{ man(Eric John) }} and lifted {{ hisd(Eric John) }} head by the hair.
"Stark," {{ he(Thord) }} said, and shook the head roughly. "Stranger!"
Eyes opened and stared at {{ him(Thord) }}, and {{Thord}} could not repress a slight shiver. It seemed that the pain and indignity had wrought some evil magic on this {{ man(Eric John) }} {{ he(Thord) }} had ridden with, and thought {{ he(Thord) }} knew. {{ He(Thord) }} had seen exactly the same gaze in a big snow-cat caught in a trap, and {{ he(Thord) }} felt suddenly that it was not a {{ man(Eric John) }} {{ he(Thord) }} spoke to, but a predatory beast.
"Stark," {{ he(Thord) }} said. "Where is the talisman of Ban Cruach?"
The Earth{{ man(Eric John) }} did not answer.
{{Thord}} laughed. {{ He(Thord) }} glanced up at the sky, where the moons rode low and swift.
"The night is only half gone. Do you think you can last it out?"
The cold, cruel, patient eyes watched {{Thord}}. There was no reply.
Some quality of pride in that gaze angered the barbarian. It seemed to mock {{ him(Thord) }}, who was so sure of {{ hisd(Thord) }} ability to loosen a reluctant tongue.
"You think I cannot make you talk, don't you? You don't know me, stranger! You don't know {{Thord}}, who can make the rocks speak out if {{ he(Thord) }} will!"
{{ He(Thord) }} reached out with {{ hisd(Thord) }} free hand and struck Stark across the face.
It seemed impossible that anything so still could move so quickly. There was an ugly flash of teeth, and {{Thord}}'s wrist was caught above the thumb-joint. {{ He(Thord) }} bellowed, and the iron jaws closed down, worrying the bone.
Quite suddenly, {{Thord}} screamed. Not for pain, but for panic. And the rows of watching {{ men(Thord) }} swayed forward, and even the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} rose up, startled.
"Hark!" ran the whispering around the fire. "Hark how {{ he(Eric John) }} growls!"
{{Thord}} had let go of Stark's hair and was beating {{ him(Eric John) }} about the head with {{ hisd(Eric John) }} clenched fist. {{ Hisd(Thord) }} face was white.
"Werewolf!" {{ he(Thord) }} screamed. "Let me go, beast-thing! Let me go!"
But the dark {{ man(Eric John) }} clung to {{Thord}}'s wrist, snarling, and did not hear. After a bit there came the dull crack of bone.
Stark opened {{ hisd(Eric John) }} jaws. {{Thord}} ceased to strike {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Thord) }} backed off slowly, staring at the torn flesh. Stark had sunk down to the length of {{ hisd(Thord) }} arms.
With {{ hisd(Thord) }} left hand, {{Thord}} drew {{ hisd(Thord) }} knife. The {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} stepped forward. "Wait, {{Thord}}!"
"It is a thing of evil," whispered the barbarian. "Warlock. Werewolf. Beast."
{{ He(Thord) }} sprang at Stark.
The {{ man(Thord) }} in armor moved, very swiftly, and the great axe went whirling through the air. It caught {{Thord}} squarely where the cords of {{ hisd(Thord) }} neck ran into the shoulder—caught, and shore on through.
There was a silence in the valley.
The {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} walked slowly across the trampled snow and took up {{ hisd(Thord) }} axe again.
"I will be obeyed," {{ he(Thord) }} said. "And I will not stand for fear, not of god, man, nor devil." {{ He(Thord) }} gestured toward Stark. "Cut {{ him(Eric John) }} down. And see that {{ he(Eric John) }} does not die."
{{ He(Thord) }} strode away, and {{Otar}} began to laugh.
From a vast distance, Stark heard that shrill, wild laughter. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} mouth was full of blood, and {{ he(Eric John) }} was mad with a cold fury.
A cunning that was purely animal guided {{ hisd(Eric John) }} movements then. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} head fell forward, and {{ hisd(Eric John) }} body hung inert against the thongs. {{ He(Eric John) }} might almost have been dead.
A knot of {{ men(Thord) }} came toward {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} listened to them. They were hesitant and afraid. Then, as {{ he(Eric John) }} did not move, they plucked up courage and came closer, and one prodded {{ him(Eric John) }} gently with the point of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} spear.
"Prick {{ him(Eric John) }} well," said another. "Let us be sure!"
The sharp point bit a little deeper. A few drops of blood welled out and joined the small red streams that ran from the weals of the lash. Stark did not stir.
The spear{{ man(Thord) }} grunted. "{{ He(Eric John) }} is safe enough now."
Stark felt the knife blades working at the thongs. {{ He(Eric John) }} waited. The rawhide snapped, and {{ he(Eric John) }} was free.
{{ He(Eric John) }} did not fall. {{ He(Eric John) }} would not have fallen then if {{ he(Eric John) }} had taken a death wound. {{ He(Eric John) }} gathered {{ hisd(Eric John) }} legs under {{ him(Eric John) }} and sprang.
{{ He(Eric John) }} picked up the spear{{ man(Thord) }} in that first rush and flung {{ him(Thord) }} into the fire. Then {{ he(Eric John) }} began to run toward the place where the scaly mounts were herded, leaving a trail of blood behind {{ him(Eric John) }} on the snow.
A {{ man(Thord) }} loomed up in front of {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} saw the shadow of a spear and swerved, and caught the haft in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} two hands. {{ He(Eric John) }} wrenched it free and struck down with the butt of it, and went on. Behind {{ him(Eric John) }} {{ he(Eric John) }} heard voices shouting and the beginning of turmoil.
The {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} turned and came back, striding fast.
There were {{ men(Thord) }} before Stark now, many {{ men(Thord) }}, the circle of watchers breaking up because there had been nothing more to watch. {{ He(Eric John) }} gripped the long spear. It was a good weapon, better than the flint-tipped stick with which the {{ boy(Eric John) }} N'Chaka had hunted the giant lizard of the rocks.
{{ Hisd(Eric John) }} body curved into a half crouch. {{ He(Eric John) }} voiced one cry, the challenging scream of a predatory killer, and went in among the {{ men(Thord) }}.
{{ He(Eric John) }} did slaughter with that spear. They were not expecting attack. They were not expecting anything. Stark had sprung to life too quickly. And they were afraid of {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} could smell the fear on them. Fear not of a person like themselves, but of a creature less and more than {{ man(Eric John) }}.
{{ He(Eric John) }} killed, and was happy.
They fell away from {{ him(Eric John) }}, the wild riders of Mekh. They were sure now that {{ he(Eric John) }} was a demon. {{ He(Eric John) }} raged among them with the bright spear, and they heard again that sound that should not have come from a human throat, and their superstitious terror rose and sent them scrambling out of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} path, trampling on each other in childish panic.
{{ He(Eric John) }} broke through, and now there was nothing between {{ him(Eric John) }} and escape but two mounted {{ men(Thord) }} who guarded the herd.
Being mounted, they had more courage. They felt that even a {{ warlock(Eric John) }} could not stand against their charge. They came at {{ him(Eric John) }} as {{ he(Eric John) }} ran, the padded feet of their beasts making a muffled drumming in the snow.
Without breaking stride, Stark hurled {{ hisd(Eric John) }} spear.
It drove through one {{ man(Thord) }}'s body and tumbled {{ him(Thord) }} off, so that {{ he(Thord) }} fell under {{ hisd(Thord) }} comrade's mount and fouled its legs. It staggered and reared up, hissing, and Stark fled on.
Once {{ he(Eric John) }} glanced over {{ hisd(Eric John) }} shoulder. Through the milling, shouting crowd of {{ men(Thord) }} {{ he(Eric John) }} glimpsed a dark, mailed figure with a winged mask, going through the ruck with a loping stride and bearing a sable axe raised high for the throwing.
Stark was close to the herd now. And they caught {{ hisd(Eric John) }} scent.
The Norland brutes had never liked the smell of {{ him(Eric John) }}, and now the reek of blood upon {{ him(Eric John) }} was enough in itself to set them wild. They began to hiss and snarl uneasily, rubbing their reptilian flanks together as they wheeled around, staring at {{ him(Eric John) }} with lambent eyes.
{{ He(Eric John) }} rushed them, before they should quite decide to break. {{ He(Eric John) }} was quick enough to catch one by the fleshy comb that served it for a forelock, held it with savage indifference to its squealing, and leaped to its back. Then {{ he(Eric John) }} let it bolt, and as {{ he(Eric John) }} rode it {{ he(Eric John) }} yelled, a shrill brute cry that urged the creatures on to panic.
The herd broke, stampeding outward from its center like a bursting shell.
Stark was in the forefront. Clinging low to the scaly neck, {{ he(Eric John) }} saw the {{ men(Thord) }} of Mekh scattered and churned and tramped into the snow by the flying pads. In and out of the shelters, kicking the brush walls down, lifting up their harsh reptilian voices, they went racketing through the camp, leaving behind them wreckage as of a storm. And Stark went with them.
{{ He(Eric John) }} snatched a cloak from off the shoulders of some petty chieftain as {{ he(Eric John) }} went by, and then, twisting cruelly on the fleshy comb, beating with {{ hisd(Eric John) }} fist at the creature's head, {{ he(Eric John) }} got {{ hisd(Eric John) }} mount turned in the way {{ he(Eric John) }} wanted it to go, down the valley.
{{ He(Eric John) }} caught one last glimpse of the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}, fighting to hold one of the creatures long enough to mount, and then a dozen striving bodies surged around {{ him(Thord) }}, and Stark was gone.
The beast did not slacken pace. It was as though it thought it could outrun the alien, bloody thing that clung to its back. The last fringes of the camp shot by and vanished in the gloom, and the clean snow of the lower valley lay open before it. The creature laid its belly to the ground and went, the white spray spurting from its heels.
Stark hung on. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} strength was gone now, run out suddenly with the battle-madness. {{ He(Eric John) }} became conscious now that {{ he(Eric John) }} was sick and bleeding, that {{ hisd(Eric John) }} body was one cruel pain. In that moment, more than in the hours that had gone before, {{ he(Eric John) }} hated the black leader of the clans of Mekh.
That flight down the valley became a sort of ugly dream. Stark was aware of rock walls reeling past, and then they seemed to widen away and the wind came out of nowhere like the stroke of a great hammer, and {{ he(Eric John) }} was on the open moors again.
The beast began to falter and slow down. Presently it stopped.
Stark scooped up snow to rub on {{ hisd(Eric John) }} wounds. {{ He(Eric John) }} came near to fainting, but the bleeding stopped and after that the pain was numbed to a dull ache. {{ He(Eric John) }} wrapped the cloak around {{ him(Eric John) }} and urged the beast to go on, gently this time, patiently, and after it had breathed it obeyed {{ him(Eric John) }}, settling into the shuffling pace it could keep up for hours.
{{ He(Eric John) }} was three days on the moors. Part of the time {{ he(Eric John) }} rode in a sort of stupor, and part of the time {{ he(Eric John) }} was feverishly alert, watching the skyline. Frequently {{ he(Eric John) }} took the shapes of thrusting rocks for riders, and found what cover {{ he(Eric John) }} could until {{ he(Eric John) }} was sure they did not move. {{ He(Eric John) }} was afraid to dismount, for the beast had no bridle. When it halted to rest {{ he(Eric John) }} remained upon its back, shaking, {{ hisd(Eric John) }} brow beaded with sweat.
The wind scoured {{ hisd(Eric John) }} tracks clean as soon as {{ he(Eric John) }} made them. Twice, in the distance, {{ he(Eric John) }} did see riders, and one of those times {{ he(Eric John) }} burrowed into a tall drift and stayed there for several hours.
The ruined towers marched with {{ him(Eric John) }} across the bitter land, lonely giants fifty miles apart. {{ He(Eric John) }} did not go near them.
{{ He(Eric John) }} knew that {{ he(Eric John) }} wandered a good bit, but {{ he(Eric John) }} could not help it, and it was probably {{ hisd(Eric John) }} salvation. In those tortured badlands, riven by ages of frost and flood, one might follow a {{ man(Eric John) }} on a straight track between two points. But to find a single rider lost in that wilderness was a matter of sheer luck, and the odds were with Stark.
One evening at sunset {{ he(Eric John) }} came out upon a plain that sloped upward to a black and towering scarp, notched with a single pass.
The light was level and blood-red, glittering on the frosty rock so that it seemed the throat of the pass was aflame with evil fires. To Stark's mind, essentially primitive and stripped now of all its acquired reason, that narrow cleft appeared as the doorway to the dwelling place of demons as horrible as the fabled creatures that roam the Darkside of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} native world.
{{ He(Eric John) }} looked long at the Gates of Death, and a dark memory crept into {{ hisd(Eric John) }} brain. Memory of that nightmare experience when the talisman had made {{ him(Eric John) }} seem to walk into that frightful pass, not as Stark, but as Ban Cruach.
{{ He(Eric John) }} remembered {{Otar}}'s words—I have seen Ban Cruach the mighty. Was {{ he(Ban) }} still there beyond those darkling gates, fighting {{ hisd(Ban) }} unimagined war, alone?
Again, in memory, Stark heard the evil piping of the wind. Again, the shadow of a dim and terrible shape loomed up before {{ him(Eric John) }}....
{{ He(Eric John) }} forced remembrance of that vision from {{ hisd(Eric John) }} mind, by a great effort. {{ He(Eric John) }} could not turn back now. There was no place to go.
{{ Hisd(Eric John) }} weary beast plodded on, and now Stark saw as in a dream that a great walled city stood guard before that awful Gate. {{ He(Eric John) }} watched the city glide toward {{ him(Eric John) }} through a crimson haze, and fancied {{ he(Eric John) }} could see the ages clustered like birds around the towers.
{{ He(Eric John) }} had reached Kushat, with the talisman of Ban Cruach still strapped in the blood-stained belt around {{ hisd(Eric John) }} waist.
IV
{{ He(Eric John) }} stood in a large square, lined about with huckster's stalls and the booths of wine-sellers. Beyond were buildings, streets, a city. Stark got a blurred impression of a grand and brooding darkness, bulking huge against the mountains, as bleak and proud as they, and quite as ancient, with many ruins and deserted quarters.
{{ He(Eric John) }} was not sure how {{ he(Eric John) }} had come there, but {{ he(Eric John) }} was standing on {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own feet, and someone was pouring sour wine into {{ hisd(Eric John) }} mouth. {{ He(Eric John) }} drank it greedily. There were people around {{ him(Eric John) }}, jostling, chattering, demanding answers to their questions. A {{ girl(Thanis) }}'s voice said sharply, "Let {{ him(Eric John) }} be! Can't you see {{ he(Eric John) }}'s hurt?"
Stark looked down. {{ She(Thanis) }} was slim and ragged, with black hair and large eyes yellow as a cat's. {{ She(Thanis) }} held a leather bottle in {{ herd(Thanis) }} hands. {{ She(Thanis) }} smiled at {{ him(Eric John) }} and said, "I'm Thanis. Will you drink more wine?"
"I will," said Stark, and did, and then said, "Thank you, Thanis." {{ He(Eric John) }} put {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hand on {{ herd(Thanis) }} shoulder, to steady {{ himself(Eric John) }}. It was a supple shoulder, surprisingly strong. {{ He(Eric John) }} liked the feel of it.
The crowd was still churning around {{ him(Eric John) }}, growing larger, and now {{ he(Eric John) }} heard the tramp of military feet. A small detachment of men and women in light armor pushed their way through.
A very young officer whose breastplate hurt the eye with brightness demanded to be told at once who Stark was and why {{ he(Lugh) }} had come there.
"No one crosses the moors in winter," {{ he(Lugh) }} said, as though that in itself were a sign of evil intent.
"The clans of Mekh are crossing them," Stark answered. "An army, to take Kushat—one, two days behind me."
The crowd picked that up. Excited voices tossed it back and forth, and clamored for more news. Stark spoke to the officer.
"I will see your captain, and at once."
"You'll see the inside of a prison, more likely!" snapped the young {{ man(Lugh) }}. "What's this nonsense about the clans of Mekh?"
Stark regarded {{ him(Lugh) }}. {{ He(Lugh) }} looked so long and so curiously that the crowd began to snicker and the officer's beardless face flushed pink to the ears.
"I have fought in many wars," said Stark gently. "And long ago I learned to listen, when someone came to warn me of attack."
"Better take {{ him(Eric John) }} to the captain, {{Lugh}}," cried Thanis. "It's our skins too, you know, if there is war."
The crowd began to shout. They were all poor folk, wrapped in threadbare cloaks or tattered leather. They had no love for the guards. And whether there was war or not, their winter had been long and dull, and they were going to make the most of this excitement.
"Take {{ him(Eric John) }}, {{Lugh}}! Let {{ him(Eric John) }} warn the nobles. Let them think how they'll defend Kushat and the Gates of Death, now that the talisman is gone!"
"That is a lie!" {{Lugh}} shouted. "And you know the penalty for telling it. Hold your tongues, or I'll have you all whipped." {{ He(Lugh) }} gestured angrily at Stark. "See if {{ he(Eric John) }} is armed."
One of the soldiers stepped forward, but Stark was quicker. {{ He(Eric John) }} slipped the thong and let the cloak fall, baring {{ hisd(Eric John) }} upper body.
"The clansmen have already taken everything I owned," {{ he(Eric John) }} said. "But they gave me something, in return."
The crowd stared at the half healed stripes that scarred {{ him(Eric John) }}, and there was a drawing in of breath.
The soldier picked up the cloak and laid it over the Earth{{ man(Eric John) }}'s shoulders. And {{Lugh}} said sullenly, "Come, then."
Stark's fingers tightened on Thanis' shoulder. "Come with me, little one," {{ he(Eric John) }} whispered. "Otherwise, I must crawl."
{{ She(Thanis) }} smiled at {{ him(Eric John) }} and came. The crowd followed.
The captain of the guards was a fleshy {{ man(Captain) }} with a smell of wine about {{ him(Captain) }} and a face already crumbling apart though {{ hisd(Captain) }} hair was not yet grey. {{ He(Captain) }} sat in a squat tower above the square, and {{ he(Captain) }} observed Stark with no particular interest.
"You had something to tell," said {{Lugh}}. "Tell it."
Stark told them, leaving out all mention of {{Camar}} and the talisman. This was neither the time nor the {{ man(Captain) }} to hear that story. The captain listened to all {{ he(Eric John) }} had to say about the gathering of the clans of Mekh, and then sat studying {{ him(Eric John) }} with a bleary shrewdness.
"You have proof of all this?"
"These stripes. Their leader {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} ordered them laid on {{ himself(Thord) }}."
The captain sighed, and leaned back.
"Any wandering band of hunters could have scourged you," {{ he(Captain) }} said. "A nameless vagabond from the gods know where, and a lawless one at that, if I'm any judge of {{ men(Eric John) }}—you probably deserved it."
{{ He(Captain) }} reached for wine, and smiled. "Look you, stranger. In the Norlands, no one makes war in the winter. And no one ever heard of {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}. If you hoped for a reward from the city, you overshot badly."
"The {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}," said Stark, grimly controlling {{ hisd(Eric John) }} anger, "will be battering at your gates within two days. And you will hear of {{ him(Thord) }} then."
"Perhaps. You can wait for {{ him(Thord) }}—in a cell. And you can leave Kushat with the first caravan after the thaw. We have enough rabble here without taking in more."
Thanis caught Stark by the cloak and held {{ him(Eric John) }} back.
"{{Sir(Captain) }}," {{ she(Thanis) }} said, as though it were an unclean word. "I will vouch for the stranger."
The captain glanced at {{ her(Thanis) }}. "You?"
"{{ Sir,(Captain) }}, I am a free citizen of Kushat. According to law, I may vouch for {{ him(Eric John) }}."
"If you scum of the Thieves' Quarter would practice the law as well as you prate it, we would have less trouble," growled the captain. "Very well, take the creature, if you want {{ him(Eric John) }}. I don't suppose you've anything to lose."
{{Lugh}} laughed.
"Name and dwelling place," said the captain, and wrote them down. "Remember, {{ he(Eric John) }} is not to leave the Quarter."
Thanis nodded. "Come," {{ she(Thanis) }} said to Stark. {{ He(Eric John) }} did not move, and {{ she(Thanis) }} looked up at {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} was staring at the captain. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} {{ beard(Eric John) }} had grown in these last days, and {{ hisd(Eric John) }} face was still scarred by {{Thord}}'s blows and made wolfish with pain and fever. And now, out of this evil mask, {{ hisd(Eric John) }} eyes were peering with a chill and terrible intensity at the soft-bellied {{ man(Captain) }} who sat and mocked {{ him(Eric John) }}.
Thanis laid {{ herd(Thanis) }} hand on {{ hisd(Eric John) }} rough cheek. "Come," {{ she(Thanis) }} said. "Come and rest."
Gently {{ she(Thanis) }} turned {{ hisd(Eric John) }} head. {{ He(Eric John) }} blinked and swayed, and {{ she(Thanis) }} took {{ him(Eric John) }} around the waist and led {{ him(Eric John) }} unprotesting to the door.
There {{ she(Thanis) }} paused, looking back.
"{{ Sir(Eric John) }}," {{ she(Thanis) }} said, very meekly, "news of this attack is being shouted through the Quarter now. If it should come, and it were known that you had the warning and did not pass it on...." {{ She(Thanis) }} made an expressive gesture, and went out.
{{Lugh}} glanced uneasily at the captain. "{{ She(Thanis) }}'s right, {{ sir(Captain) }}. If by chance the {{ man(Eric John) }} did tell the truth...."
The captain swore. "Rot. A rogue's tale. And yet...." {{ He(Captain) }} scowled indecisively, and then reached for parchment. "After all, it's a simple thing. Write it up, pass it on, and let the nobles do the worrying."
{{ Hisd(Captain) }} pen began to scratch.
Thanis took Stark by steep and narrow ways, darkling now in the afterglow, where the city climbed and fell again over the uneven rock. Stark was aware of the heavy smells of spices and unfamiliar foods, and the musky undertones of a million generations swarmed together to spawn and die in these crowded catacombs of slate and stone.
There was a house, blending into other houses, close under the loom of the great Wall. There was a flight of steps, hollowed deep with use, twisting crazily around outer corners.
There was a low room, and a slender {{ man(Balin) }} named {{Balin}}, vaguely glimpsed, who said {{ he(Balin) }} was Thanis' {{ brother(Balin) }}. There was a bed of skins and woven cloths.
Stark slept.
Hands and voices called {{ him(Eric John) }} back. Strong hands shaking {{ him(Eric John) }}, urgent voices. {{ He(Eric John) }} started up growling, like an animal suddenly awaked, still lost in the dark mists of exhaustion. {{Balin}} swore, and caught {{ hisd(Balin) }} fingers away.
"What is this you have brought home, Thanis? By the gods, it snapped at me!"
Thanis ignored {{ him(Balin) }}. "Stark," {{ she(Thanis) }} said. "Stark! Listen. People} are coming. Soldiers. They will question you. Do you hear me?"
Stark said heavily, "I hear."
"Do not speak of {{Camar}}!"
Stark got to {{ hisd(Eric John) }} feet, and {{Balin}} said hastily, "Peace! The thing is safe. I would not steal a death warrant!"
{{ Hisd(Balin) }} voice had a ring of truth. Stark sat down again. It was an effort to keep awake. There was clamor in the street below. It was still night.
{{Balin}} said carefully, "Tell them what you told the captain, nothing more. They will kill you if they know."
A rough hand thundered at the door, and a voice cried, "Open up!"
{{Balin}} sauntered over to lift the bar. Thanis sat beside Stark, {{ hers(Thanis) }} hand touching {{ hisd(Eric John) }}. Stark rubbed {{ hisd(Eric John) }} face. {{ He(Eric John) }} had been {{ shaved(Eric John) }} and washed, {{ hisd(Eric John) }} wounds rubbed with salve. The belt was gone, and {{ hisd(Eric John) }} blood-stained clothing. {{ He(Eric John) }} realized only then that {{ he(Eric John) }} was naked, and drew a cloth around {{ him(Eric John) }}. Thanis whispered, "The belt is there on that peg, under your cloak."
{{Balin}} opened the door, and the room was full of people.
Stark recognized the captain. There were others, four of them, young, old, intermediate, annoyed at being hauled away from their beds and their gaming tables at this hour. The sixth {{ man(Rogain) }} wore the jewelled cuirass of a noble. {{ He(Rogain) }} had a nice, a kind face. Grey hair, mild eyes, soft cheeks. A fine {{ man(Rogain) }}, but ludicrous in the trappings of a soldier.
"Is this the {{ man(Eric John) }}?" {{ he(Rogain) }} asked, and the captain nodded.
"Yes." It was {{ hisd(Captain) }} turn to say {{ Sir(Rogain) }}.
{{Balin}} brought a chair. {{ He(Rogain) }} had a fine flourish about {{ him(Rogain) }}. {{ He(Rogain) }} wore a crimson jewel in {{ hisd(Rogain) }} left ear, and every line of {{ him(Rogain) }} was quick and sensitive, instinct with mockery. {{ Hisd(Rogain) }} eyes were brightly cynical, in a face worn lean with years of merry sinning. Stark liked {{ him(Rogain) }}.
{{ He(Rogain) }} was a civilized {{ man(Rogain) }}. They all were—the noble, the captain, the lot of them. So civilized that the origins of their culture were forgotten half an age before the first clay brick was laid in Babylon.
Too civilized, Stark thought. Peace had drawn their fangs and cut their claws. {{ He(Eric John) }} thought of the wild clansmen coming fast across the snow, and felt a certain pity for the people of Kushat.
The noble sat down.
"This is a strange tale you bring, wanderer. I would hear it from your own lips."
Stark told it. {{ He(Eric John) }} spoke slowly, watching every word, cursing the weariness that fogged {{ hisd(Eric John) }} brain.
The noble, who was called {{Rogain}}, asked {{ him(Eric John) }} questions. Where was the camp? How many {{ men(Thord) }}? What were the exact words of the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}, and who was {{ he(Eric John) }}?
Stark answered, with meticulous care.
{{Rogain}} sat for some time lost in thought. {{ He(Rogain) }} seemed worried and upset, one hand playing aimlessly with the hilt of {{ hisd(Rogain) }} sword. A scholar's hand, without a callous on it.
"There is one thing more," said {{Rogain}}. "What business had you on the moors in winter?"
Stark smiled. "I am a wanderer by profession."
"Outlaw?" asked the captain, and Stark shrugged.
"Mercenary is a kinder word."
{{Rogain}} studied the pattern of stripes on the Earth{{ man(Eric John) }}'s dark skin. "Why did the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}, so-called, order you scourged?"
"I had thrashed one of {{ hisd(Thord) }} chieftains."
{{Rogain}} sighed and rose. {{ He(Rogain) }} stood regarding Stark from under brooding brows, and at length {{ he(Rogain) }} said, "It is a wild tale. I can't believe it—and yet, why should you lie?"
{{ He(Rogain) }} paused, as though hoping that Stark would answer that and relieve {{ him(Rogain) }} of worry.
Stark yawned. "The tale is easily proved. Wait a day or two."
"I will arm the city," said Rogain. "I dare not do otherwise. But I will tell you this." An astonishing unpleasant look came into {{ hisd(Rogain) }} eyes. "If the attack does not come—if you have set a whole city by the ears for nothing—I will have you flayed alive and your body tumbled over the Wall for the carrion birds to feed on."
{{ He(Rogain) }} strode out, taking {{ hisd(Rogain) }} retinue with {{ him(Rogain) }}. {{Balin}} smiled. "{{ He(Rogain) }} will do it, too," {{ he(Balin) }} said, and dropped the bar.
Stark did not answer. {{ He(Eric John) }} stared at {{Balin}}, and then at Thanis, and then at the belt hanging on the peg, in a curiously blank and yet penetrating fashion, like an animal that thinks its own thoughts. {{ He(Eric John) }} took a deep breath. Then, as though {{ he(Eric John) }} found the air clean of danger, {{ he(Eric John) }} rolled over and went instantly to sleep.
{{Balin}} lifted {{ hisd(Balin) }} shoulders expressively. {{ He(Balin) }} grinned at Thanis. "Are you positive it's human?"
"{{ He(Eric John) }}'s beautiful," said Thanis, and tucked the cloths around {{ him(Eric John) }}. "Hold your tongue." {{ She(Thanis) }} continued to sit there, watching Stark's face as the slow dreams moved across it. {{Balin}} laughed.
It was evening again when Stark awoke. {{ He(Eric John) }} sat up, stretching lazily. Thanis crouched by the hearthstone, stirring something savory in a blackened pot. {{ She(Thanis) }} wore a red kirtle and a necklet of beaten gold, and {{ herd(Thanis) }} hair was combed out smooth and shining.
{{ She(Thanis) }} smiled at {{ him(Eric John) }} and rose, bringing {{ him(Eric John) }} {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own boots and trousers, carefully cleaned, and a tunic of leather tanned fine and soft as silk. Stark asked {{ her(Thanis) }} where {{ she(Thanis) }} got it.
"{{Balin}} stole it—from the baths where the nobles go. {{ He(Balin) }} said you might as well have the best." {{ She(Thanis) }} laughed. "{{ He(Balin) }} had a devil of a time finding one big enough to fit you."
{{ She(Thanis) }} watched with unashamed interest while {{ he(Eric John) }} dressed. Stark said, "Don't burn the soup."
{{ She(Thanis) }} put {{ herd(Thanis) }} tongue out at {{ him(Eric John) }}. "Better be proud of that fine hide while you have it," {{ she(Thanis) }} said. "There's no sign of attack."
Stark was aware of sounds that had not been there before—the pacing of soldiers on the Wall above the house, the calling of the watch. Kushat was armed and ready—and {{ hisd(Eric John) }} time was running out. {{ He(Eric John) }} hoped that {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} had not been delayed on the moors.
Thanis said, "I should explain about the belt. When {{Balin}} undressed you, {{ he(Balin) }} saw {{Camar}}'s name scratched on the inside of the boss. And, {{ he(Balin) }} can open a lizard's egg without harming the shell."
"What about you?" asked Stark.
{{ She(Thanis) }} flexed {{ herd(Thanis) }} supple fingers. "I do well enough."
{{Balin}} came in. {{ He(Balin) }} had been seeking news, but there was little to be had.
"The soldiers are grumbling about a false alarm," {{ he(Balin) }} said. "The people are excited, but more as though they were playing a game. Kushat has not fought a war for centuries." {{ He(Balin) }} sighed. "The pity of it is, Stark, I believe your story. And I'm afraid."
Thanis handed {{ him(Eric John) }} a steaming bowl. "Here—employ your tongue with this. Afraid, indeed! Have you forgotten the Wall? No one has carried it since the city was built. Let them attack!"
Stark was amused. "For a {{ child(Thanis) }}, you know much concerning war."
"I knew enough to save your skin!" {{ she(Thanis) }} flared, and {{Balin}} smiled.
"{{ She(Thanis) }} has you there, Stark. And speaking of skins...." {{ He(Balin) }} glanced up at the belt. "Or better, speaking of talismans, which we were not. How did you come by it?"
Stark told {{ him(Balin) }}. "{{ He(Camar) }} had a sin on {{ hisd(Camar) }} soul, did {{Camar}}. And—{{ he(Camar) }} was my friend."
{{Balin}} looked at {{ him(Eric John) }} with deep respect. "You were a fool," {{ he(Balin) }} said. "Look you. The thing is returned to Kushat. Your promise is kept. There is nothing for you here but danger, and were I you I would not wait to be flayed, or slain, or taken in a quarrel that is not yours."
"Ah," said Stark softly, "but it is mine. The {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} made it so." {{ He(Eric John) }}, too, glanced at the belt. "What of the talisman?"
"Return it where it came from," Thanis said. "My {{ brother(Balin) }} is a better thief than {{Camar}}. {{ He(Balin) }} can certainly do that."
"No!" said {{Balin}}, with surprising force. "We will keep it, Stark and I. Whether it has power, I do not know. But if it has—I think Kushat will need it, and in strong hands."
Stark said somberly, "It has power, the Talisman. Whether for good or evil, I don't know."
They looked at {{ him(Eric John) }}, startled. But a touch of awe seemed to repress their curiosity.
{{ He(Eric John) }} could not tell them. {{ He(Eric John) }} was, somehow, reluctant to tell anyone of that dark vision of what lay beyond the Gates of Death, which the talisman of Ban Cruach had lent {{ him(Eric John) }}.
{{Balin}} stood up. "Well, for good or evil, at least the sacred relic of Ban Cruach has come home." {{ He(Balin) }} yawned. "I am going to bed. Will you come, Thanis, or will you stay and quarrel with our guest?"
"I will stay," {{ she(Thanis) }} said, "and quarrel."
"Ah, well." {{Balin}} sighed puckishly. "Good night." {{ He(Balin) }} vanished into an inner room. Stark looked at Thanis. {{ She(Thanis) }} had a warm mouth, and {{ herd(Thanis) }} eyes were beautiful, and full of light.
{{ He(Eric John) }} smiled, holding out {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hand.
The night wore on, and Stark lay drowsing. Thanis had opened the curtains. Wind and moonlight swept together into the room, and {{ she(Thanis) }} stood leaning upon the sill, above the slumbering city. The smile that lingered in the corners of {{ herd(Thanis) }} mouth was sad and far-away, and very tender.
Stark stirred uneasily, making small sounds in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} throat. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} motions grew violent. Thanis crossed the room and touched {{ him(Eric John) }}.
Instantly {{ he(Eric John) }} was awake.
"Animal," {{ she(Thanis) }} said softly. "You dream."
Stark shook {{ hisd(Eric John) }} head. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} eyes were still clouded, though not with sleep. "Blood," {{ he(Eric John) }} said, "heavy in the wind."
"I smell nothing but the dawn," {{ she(Thanis) }} said, and laughed.
Stark rose. "Get {{Balin}}. I'm going up on the Wall."
{{ She(Thanis) }} did not know {{ him(Eric John) }} now. "What is it, Stark? What's wrong?"
"Get {{Balin}}." Suddenly it seemed that the room stifled {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} caught up {{ hisd(Eric John) }} cloak and {{Camar}}'s belt and flung open the door, standing on the narrow steps outside. The moonlight caught in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} eyes, pale as frost-fire.
Thanis shivered. {{Balin}} joined {{ her(Thanis) }} without being called. {{ He(Balin) }}, too, had slept but lightly. Together they followed Stark up the rough-cut stair that led to the top of the Wall.
{{ He(Eric John) }} looked southward, where the plain ran down from the mountains and spread away below Kushat. Nothing moved out there. Nothing marred the empty whiteness. But Stark said,
"They will attack at dawn."
V
They waited. Some distance away a guard leaned against the parapet, huddled in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} cloak. {{ He(Eric John) }} glanced at them incuriously. It was bitterly cold. The wind came whistling down through the Gates of Death, and below in the streets the watchfires shuddered and flared.
They waited, and still there was nothing.
{{Balin}} said impatiently, "How can you know they're coming?"
Stark shivered, a shallow rippling of the flesh that had nothing to do with cold, and every muscle of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} body came alive. Phobos plunged downward. The moonlight dimmed and changed, and the plain was very empty, very still.
"They will wait for darkness. They will have an hour or so, between moonset and dawn."
Thanis muttered, "Dreams! Besides, I'm cold." {{ She(Thanis) }} hesitated, and then crept in under Balin's cloak. Stark had gone away from {{ her(Thanis) }}. {{ She(Thanis) }} watched {{ him(Eric John) }} sulkily where {{ he(Eric John) }} leaned upon the stone. {{ He(Eric John) }} might have been part of it, as dark and unstirring.
Deimos sank low toward the west.
Stark turned {{ hisd(Eric John) }} head, drawn inevitably to look toward the cliffs above Kushat, soaring upward to blot out half the sky. Here, close under them, they seemed to tower outward in a curving mass, like the last wave of eternity rolling down, crested white with the ash of shattered worlds.
I have stood beneath those cliffs before. I have felt them leaning down to crush me, and I have been afraid.
{{ He(Eric John) }} was still afraid. The mind that had poured its memories into that crystal lens had been dead a million years, but neither time nor death had dulled the terror that beset Ban Cruach in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} journey through that nightmare pass.
{{ He(Eric John) }} looked into the black and narrow mouth of the Gates of Death, cleaving the scarp like a wound, and the primitive ape-thing within {{ him(Eric John) }} cringed and moaned, oppressed with a sudden sense of fate.
{{ He(Eric John) }} had come painfully across half a world, to crouch before the Gates of Death. Some evil magic had let {{ him(Eric John) }} see forbidden things, had linked {{ hisd(Eric John) }} mind in an unholy bond with the long-dead mind of one who had been half a {{ god(Ban) }}. These evil miracles had not been for nothing. {{ He(Eric John) }} would not be allowed to go unscathed.
{{ He(Eric John) }} drew {{ himself(Eric John) }} up sharply then, and swore. {{ He(Eric John) }} had left N'Chaka behind, a naked {{ boy(Eric John) }} running in a place of rocks and sun on Mercury. {{ He(Eric John) }} had become {{Eric John}} Stark, a {{ man(Eric John) }}, and civilized. {{ He(Eric John) }} thrust the senseless premonition from {{ him(Eric John) }}, and turned {{ hisd(Eric John) }} back upon the mountains.
Deimos touched the horizon. A last gleam of reddish light tinged the snow, and then was gone.
Thanis, who was half asleep, said with sudden irritation, "I do not believe in your barbarians. I'm going home." {{ She(Thanis) }} thrust {{Balin}} aside and went away, down the steps.
The plain was now in utter darkness, under the faint, far Northern stars.
Stark settled {{ himself(Eric John) }} against the parapet. There was a sort of timeless patience about {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{Balin}} envied it. {{ He(Balin) }} would have liked to go with Thanis. {{ He(Balin) }} was cold and doubtful, but {{ he(Balin) }} stayed.
Time passed, endless minutes of it, lengthening into what seemed hours.
Stark said, "Can you hear them?"
"No."
"They come." {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} hearing, far keener than {{Balin}}'s, picked up the little sounds, the vast inchoate rustling of an army on the move in stealth and darkness. Light-armed {{ men(Thord) }}, hunters, used to stalking wild beasts in the show. They could move softly, very softly.
"I hear nothing," {{Balin}} said, and again they waited.
The westering stars moved toward the horizon, and at length in the east a dim pallor crept across the sky.
The plain was still shrouded in night, but now Stark could make out the high towers of the {{ King(Thord) }} City of Kushat, ghostly and indistinct—the ancient, proud high towers of the rulers and their nobles, set above the crowded Quarters of merchants and artisans and thieves. {{ He(Eric John) }} wondered who would be {{ king(King) }} in Kushat by the time this unrisen sun had set.
"You were wrong," said {{Balin}}, peering. "There is nothing on the plain."
Stark said, "Wait."
Swiftly now, in the thin air of Mars, the dawn came with a rush and a leap, flooding the world with harsh light. It flashed in cruel brilliance from sword-blades, from spearheads, from helmets and burnished mail, from the war-harness of beasts, glistened on bare russet heads and coats of leather, set the banners of the clans to burning, crimson and gold and green, bright against the snow.
There was no sound, not a whisper, in all the land.
Somewhere a hunting horn sent forth one deep cry to split the morning. Then burst out the wild skirling of the mountain pipes and the broken thunder of drums, and a wordless scream of exultation that rang back from the Wall of Kushat like the very voice of battle. The {{ men(Thord) }} of Mekh began to move.
Raggedly, slowly at first, then more swiftly as the press of warriors broke and flowed, the barbarians swept toward the city as water sweeps over a broken dam.
Knots and clumps of {{ men(Thord) }}, tall {{ men(Thord) }} running like deer, leaping, shouting, swinging their great brands. Riders, spurring their mounts until they fled belly down. Spears, axes, sword-blades tossing, a sea of warriors and beasts, rushing, trampling, shaking the ground with the thunder of their going.
And ahead of them all came a solitary figure in black mail, riding a raking beast trapped all in black, and bearing a sable axe.
Kushat came to life. There was a swarming and a yelling in the streets, and soldiers began to pour up onto the Wall. A thin company, Stark thought, and shook {{ hisd(Eric John) }} head. Mobs of citizens choked the alleys, and every rooftop was full. A troop of nobles went by, brave in their bright mail, to take up their post in the square by the great gate.
{{Balin}} said nothing, and Stark did not disturb {{ hisd(Balin) }} thoughts. From the look of {{ him(Balin) }}, they were dark indeed.
Soldiers came and ordered them off the Wall. They went back to their own roof, where they were joined by Thanis. {{ She(Thanis) }} was in a high state of excitement, but unafraid.
"Let them attack!" {{ she(Thanis) }} said. "Let them break their spears against the Wall. They will crawl away again."
Stark began to grow restless. Up in their high emplacements, the big ballistas creaked and thrummed. The muted song of the bows became a wailing hum. Fighters fell, and were kicked off the ledges by their fellows. The blood-howl of the clans rang unceasing on the frosty air, and Stark heard the rap of scaling ladders against stone.
Thanis said abruptly, "What is that—that sound like thunder?"
"Rams," {{ he(Eric John) }} answered. "They are battering the gate."
{{ She(Thanis) }} listened, and Stark saw in {{ herd(Thanis) }} face the beginning of fear.
It was a long fight. Stark watched it hungrily from the roof all that morning. The soldiers of Kushat did bravely and well, but they were as folded sheep against the tall killers of the mountains. By noon the officers were beating the Quarters for soldiers to replace the slain.
Stark and {{Balin}} went up again, onto the Wall.
The clans had suffered. Their dead lay in windrows under the Wall, amid the broken ladders. But Stark knew {{ hisd(Eric John) }} barbarians. They had sat restless and chafing in the valley for many days, and now the battle-madness was on them and they were not going to be stopped.
Wave after wave of them rolled up, and was cast back, and came on again relentlessly. The intermittent thunder boomed still from the gates, where sweating giants swung the rams under cover of their own bowmen. And everywhere, up and down through the forefront of the fighting, rode the {{ man(Thord) }} in black armor, and wild cheering followed {{ him(Thord) }}.
{{Balin}} said heavily, "It is the end of Kushat."
A ladder banged against the stones a few feet away. {{ Men(Thord) }} swarmed up the rungs, fierce-eyed clansmen with laughter in their mouths. Stark was first at the head.
They had given {{ him(Eric John) }} a spear. {{ He(Eric John) }} spitted two {{ men(Thord) }} through with it and lost it, and a third {{ man(Thord) }} came leaping over the parapet. Stark received {{ him(Thord) }} into {{ hisd(Eric John) }} arms.
{{Balin}} watched. {{ He(Balin) }} saw the warrior go crashing back, sweeping {{ hisd(Thord) }} fellows off the ladder. {{ He(Balin) }} saw Stark's face. {{ He(Balin) }} heard the sounds and smelled the blood and sweat of war, and {{ he(Balin) }} was sick to the marrow of {{ hisd(Balin) }} bones, and {{ hisd(Balin) }} hatred of the barbarians was a terrible thing.
Stark caught up a dead {{ man(Thord) }}'s blade, and within ten minutes {{ hisd(Eric John) }} arm was as red as a butcher's. And ever {{ he(Eric John) }} watched the winged helm that went back and forth below, a standard to the clans.
By mid-afternoon the barbarians had gained the Wall in three places. They spread inward along the ledges, pouring up in a resistless tide, and the defenders broke. The rout became a panic.
"It's all over now," Stark said. "Find Thanis, and hide {{ her(Thanis) }}."
{{Balin}} let fall {{ hisd(Balin) }} sword. "Give me the talisman," {{ he(Balin) }} whispered, and Stark saw that {{ he(Balin) }} was weeping. "Give it me, and I will go beyond the Gates of Death and rouse Ban Cruach from {{ hisd(Ban) }} sleep. And if {{ he(Ban) }} has forgotten Kushat, I will take {{ hisd(Ban) }} power into my own hands. I will fling wide the Gates of Death and loose destruction on the {{ men(Thord) }} of Mekh—or if the legends are all lies, then I will die."
{{ He(Balin) }} was like a {{ man(Balin) }} crazed. "Give me the talisman!"
Stark slapped {{ him(Balin) }}, carefully and without heat, across the face. "Get your {{ sister(Thanis) }}, {{Balin}}. Hide {{ her(Thanis) }}, unless you would be {{ uncle(Balin) }} to a red-haired brat."
{{ He(Balin) }} went then, like a {{ man(Balin) }} who has been stunned. Screaming men and women with their children clogged the ways that led inward from the Wall, and there was bloody work afoot on the rooftops and in the narrow alleys.
The gate was holding, still.
Stark forced {{ hisd(Eric John) }} way toward the square. The booths of the hucksters were overthrown, the wine-jars broken and the red wine spilled. Beasts squealed and stamped, tired of their chafing harness, driven wild by the shouting and the smell of blood. The dead were heaped high where they had fallen from above.
They were all soldiers here, clinging grimly to their last foothold. The deep song of the rams shook the very stones. The iron-sheathed timbers of the gate gave back an answering scream, and toward the end all other sounds grew hushed. The nobles came down slowly from the Wall and mounted, and sat waiting.
There were fewer of them now. Their bright armor was dented and stained, and their faces had a pallor on them.
One last hammer-stroke of the rams.
With a bitter shriek the weakened bolts tore out, and the great gate was broken through.
The nobles of Kushat made their first, and final charge.
As soldiers they went up against the riders of Mekh, and as soldiers they held them until they died. Those that were left were borne back into the square, caught as in the crest of an avalanche. And first through the gates came the winged battle-mask of the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}, and the sable axe that drank warrior's lives where it hewed.
There was a beast with no rider to claim it, tugging at its headrope. Stark swung onto the saddle pad and cut it free. Where the press was thickest, a welter of struggling brutes and people fighting knee to knee, there was the {{ man(Thord) }} in black armor, riding like a {{ god(Thord) }}, magnificent, born to war. Stark's eyes shone with a strange, cold light. {{ He(Thord) }} struck {{ hisd(Thord) }} heels hard into the scaly flanks. The beast plunged forward.
In and over and through, making the long sword sing. The beast was strong, and frightened beyond fear. It bit and trampled, and Stark cut a path for them, and presently {{ he(Eric John) }} shouted above the din,
"Ho, there! {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}!"
The black mask turned toward {{ him(Eric John) }}, and the remembered voice spoke from behind the barred slot, joyously.
"The wanderer. The wild {{ man(Eric John) }}!"
Their two mounts shocked together. The axe came down in a whistling curve, and a red sword-blade flashed to meet it. Swift, swift, a ringing clash of steel, and the blade was shattered and the axe fallen to the ground.
Stark pressed in.
{{ Ciaran(Thord) }} reached for {{ hisd(Thord) }} sword, but {{ hisd(Thord) }} hand was numbed by the force of that blow and {{ he(Thord) }} was slow, a split second. The hilt of Stark's weapon, still clutched in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own numbed grip, fetched {{ him(Eric John) }} a stunning blow on the helm, so that the metal rang like a flawed bell.
The {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} reeled back, only for a moment, but long enough. Stark grasped the war-mask and ripped it off, and got {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hands around the naked throat.
{{ He(Eric John) }} did not break that neck, as {{ he(Eric John) }} had planned. And the Clansmen who had started in to save their leader stopped and did not move.
Stark knew now why the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} had never shown {{ hisd(Thord) }} face.
The throat {{ he(Thord) }} held was white and strong, and {{ hisdEric John) }} hands around it were buried in a mane of red-gold hair that fell down over the shirt of mail. A red mouth passionate with fury, wonderful curving bone under sculptured flesh, eyes fierce and proud and tameless as the eyes of a young eagle, fire-blue, defying {{ him(Eric John) }}, hating {{ him(Eric John) }}....
"By the gods," said Stark, very softly. "By the eternal gods!"
VI
A {{ woman-opp(Thord) }}! And in that moment of amazement, {{ she-opp(Thord) }} was quicker than {{ he(Eric John) }}.
There was nothing to warn {{ him(Eric John) }}, no least flicker of expression. {{ Herd-opp(Thord) }} two fists came up together between {{ hisd(Eric John) }} outstretched arms and caught {{ him(Eric John) }} under the jaw with a force that nearly snapped {{ hisd(Eric John) }} neck. {{ He(Eric John) }} went over backward, clean out of the saddle, and lay sprawled on the bloody stones, half stunned, the wind knocked out of {{ him(Eric John) }}.
The {{ woman-opp(Thord) }} wheeled {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} mount. Bending low, {{ she-opp(Thord) }} took up the axe from where it had fallen, and faced {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} warriors, who were as dazed as Stark.
"I have led you well," {{ she-opp(Thord) }} said. "I have taken you Kushat. Will any of you dispute me?"
They knew the axe, if they did not know {{ her-opp(Thord) }}. They looked from side to side uneasily, completely at a loss, and Stark, still gasping on the ground, thought that {{ he(Eric John) }} had never seen anything as proud and beautiful as {{ she-opp(Thord) }} was then in {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} black mail, with {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} bright hair blowing and {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} glance like blue lightning.
The nobles of Kushat chose that moment to charge. This strange unmasking of the Mekhish chief had given them time to rally, and now they thought that the Gods had wrought a miracle to help them. They found hope, where they had lost everything but courage.
"A {{ wench-opp(Thord) }}!" they cried. "A {{ strumpet-opp(Thord)}} of the camps. A {{ woman-opp(Thord) }}!"
They howled it like an epithet, and tore into the barbarians.
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} who had been the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} drove the spurs in deep, so that the beast leaped forward screaming. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} went, and did not look to see if any had followed, in among the {{ men(Thord) }} of Kushat. And the great axe rose and fell, and rose again.
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} killed three, and left two others bleeding on the stones, and not once did {{ she-opp(Thord) }} look back.
The clans{{ men(Thord) }} found their tongues.
"{{ Ciaran(Thord) }}! {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}!"
The crashing shout drowned out the sound of battle. As one, they turned and followed {{ her-opp(Thord) }}.
Stark, scrambling for {{ hisd(Eric John) }} life underfoot, could not forbear smiling. Their childlike minds could see only two alternatives—to slay {{ her-opp(Thord) }} out of hand, or to worship {{ her-opp(Thord) }}. They had chosen to worship. {{ He(Eric John) }} thought the bards would be singing of the {{ Lord(Thord) }} {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} of Mekh as long as there were folk to listen.
{{ He(Eric John) }} managed to take cover behind a wrecked booth, and presently make {{ hisd(Eric John) }} way out of the square. They had forgotten {{ him(Eric John) }}, for the moment. {{ He(Eric John) }} did not wish to wait, just then, until they—or {{ she-opp(Thord) }}—remembered.
{{ She-opp(Thord) }}.
{{ He(Eric John) }} still did not believe it, quite. {{ He(Eric John) }} touched the bruise under {{ hisd(Eric John) }} jaw where {{ she-opp(Thord) }} had struck {{ him(Eric John) }}, and thought of the lithe, swift strength of {{ he-oppr(Thord) }}, and the way {{ she-opp(Thord) }} had ridden alone into battle. {{ He(Eric John) }} remembered the death of {{Thord}}, and how {{ she-opp(Thord) }} had kept {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} red wolves tamed, and {{ he(Eric John) }} was filled with wonder, and a deep excitement.
{{ He(Eric John) }} remembered what {{ she-opp(Thord) }} had said to {{ him(Eric John) }} once—We are of one blood, though we be strangers.
{{ He(Eric John) }} laughed, silently, and {{ hisd(Eric John) }} eyes were very bright.
The tide of war had rolled on toward the {{ King(Thord) }} City, where from the sound of it there was hot fighting around the castle. Eddies of the main struggle swept shrieking through the streets, but the rat-runs under the Wall were clear. Everyone had stampeded inward, the victims with the victors close on their heels. The short northern day was almost gone.
{{ He(Eric John) }} found a hiding place that offered reasonable safety, and settled {{ himself(Eric John) }} to wait.
Night came, but {{ he(Eric John) }} did not move. From the sounds that reached {{ him(Eric John) }}, the sacking of Kushat was in full swing. They were looting the richer streets first. Their upraised voices were thick with wine, and mingled with the cries of men and women. The reflection of many fires tinged the sky.
By midnight the sounds began to slacken, and by the second hour after the city slept, drugged with wine and blood and the weariness of battle. Stark went silently out into the streets, toward the {{ King(Thord) }} City.
According to the immemorial pattern of Martian city-states, the castles of the {{ king(Thord) }} and the noble families were clustered together in solitary grandeur. Many of the towers were fallen now, the great halls open to the sky. Time had crushed the grandeur that had been Kushat, more fatally than the boots of any conqueror.
In the house of the {{ king(Thord) }}, the flamboys guttered low and the chieftains of Mekh slept with their weary pipers among the benches of the banquet hall. In the niches of the tall, carved portal, the guards nodded over their spears. They, too, had fought that day. Even so, Stark did not go near them.
Shivering slightly in the bitter wind, {{ he(Eric John) }} followed the bulk of the massive walls until {{ he(Eric John) }} found a postern door, half open as some kitchen knave had left it in his flight. Stark entered, moving like a shadow.
The passageway was empty, dimly lighted by a single torch. A stairway branched off from it, and {{ he(Eric John) }} climbed that, picking {{ hisd(Eric John) }} way by guess and {{ hisd(Eric John) }} memories of similar castles {{ he(Eric John) }} had seen in the past.
{{ He(Eric John) }} emerged into a narrow hall, obviously for the use of servants. A tapestry closed the end, stirring in the chill draught that blew along the floor. {{ He(Eric John) }} peered around it, and saw a massive, vaulted corridor, the stone walls panelled in wood much split and blackened by time, but still showing forth the wonderful carvings of beasts and people, larger than life and overlaid with gold and bright enamel.
From the corridor a single doorway opened—and {{Otar}} slept before it, curled on a pallet like a dog.
Stark went back down the narrow hall. {{ He(Eric John) }} was sure that there must be a back entrance to the {{ king(Thord) }}'s chambers, and {{ he(Eric John) }} found the little door {{ he(Eric John) }} was looking for.
From there on was darkness. {{ He(Eric John) }} felt {{ hisd(Eric John) }} way, stepping with infinite caution, and presently there was a faint gleam of light filtering around the edges of another curtain of heavy tapestry.
{{ He(Eric John) }} crept toward it, and heard slow breathing on the other side.
{{ He(Eric John) }} drew the curtain back, a careful inch. The {{ man(guard) }} was sprawled on a bench athwart the door. {{ He(guard) }} slept the honest sleep of exhaustion, {{ hisd(guard) }} sword in {{ hisd(guard) }} hand, the stains of {{ hisd(guard) }} day's work still upon {{ him(guard) }}. {{ He(guard) }} was alone in the small room. A door in the farther wall was closed.
Stark hit {{ him(guard) }}, and caught the sword before it fell. The {{ man(guard) }} grunted once and became utterly relaxed. Stark bound {{ him(guard) }} with {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own harness and shoved a gag in {{ hisd(guard) }} mouth, and went on, through the door in the opposite wall.
The room beyond was large and high and full of shadows. A fire burned low on the hearth, and the uncertain light showed dimly the hangings and the rich stuffs that carpeted the floor, and the dark, sparse shapes of furniture.
Stark made out the lattice-work of a covered bed, let into the wall after the northern fashion.
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} was there, sleeping, {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} red-gold hair the colour of the flames.
{{ He(Eric John) }} stood a moment, watching {{ her-opp(Thord) }}, and then, as though {{ she-opp(Thord) }} sensed {{ hisd(Eric John) }} presence, {{ she-opp(Thord) }} stirred and opened {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} eyes.
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} did not cry out. {{ He(Eric John) }} had known that {{ she-opp(Thord) }} would not. There was no fear in {{ her-opp(Thord) }}. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} said, with a kind of wry humor, "I will have a word with my guards about this."
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} flung aside the covering and rose. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} was almost as tall as {{ he(Eric John) }}, white-skinned and very straight. {{ He(Eric John) }} noted the long thighs, the narrow loins and magnificent shoulders, the impressive chest. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} moved as a {{ man(Thord) }} moves, without flaw. A long furred gown, that Stark guessed had lately graced the shoulders of the {{ king(Thord) }}, lay over a chair. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} put it on.
"Well, wild {{ man(Eric John) }}?"
"I have come to warn you." {{ He(Eric John) }} hesitated over {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} name, and {{ she-opp(Thord) }} said,
"My {{ mother-opp(Thord) }} named me {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}” {{ She-opp(Thord) }} gave {{ him(Eric John) }} {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} falcon's glance. "I could have slain you in the square, but now I think you did me a service. The truth would have come out sometime—better then, when they had no time to think about it." {{ She-opp(Thord) }} laughed. "They will follow me now, over the edge of the world, if I ask them."
Stark said slowly, "Even beyond the Gates of Death?"
"Certainly, there. Above all, there!"
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} turned to one of the tall windows and looked out at the cliffs and the high notch of the pass, touched with greenish silver by the little moons.
"Ban Cruach was a great {{ king(Ban) }}. {{ He(Ban) }} came out of nowhere to rule the Norlands with a rod of iron, and people speak of {{ him(Ban) }} still as half a {{ god(Ban) }}. Where did {{ he(Ban) }} get {{ hisd(Ban) }} power, if not from beyond the Gates of Death? Why did {{ he(Ban) }} go back there at the end of {{ hisd(Ban) }} days, if not to hide away {{ hisd(Ban) }} secret? Why did {{ he(Ban) }} build Kushat to guard the pass forever, if not to hoard that power out of reach of all the other nations of Mars?
"Yes, Stark. My {{ men(Thord) }} will follow me. And if they do not, I will go alone."
"You are not Ban Cruach. Nor am I." {{ He(Eric John) }} took {{ her-opp(Thord) }} by the shoulders. "Listen, {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}. You're already {{ king(Thord) }} in the Norlands, and half a legend as you stand. Be content."
"Content!" {{ Herd-opp(Thord) }} face was close to {{ his(Eric John) }}, and {{ he(Eric John) }} saw the blaze of it, the white intensity of ambition and an iron pride. "Are you content?" {{ she-opp(Thord) }} asked {{ him(Eric John) }}. "Have you ever been content?"
{{ He(Eric John) }} smiled. "For strangers, we do know each other well. No. But the spurs are not so deep in me."
"The wind and the fire. One spends its strength in wandering, the other devours. But one can help the other. I made you an offer once, and you said you would not bargain unless you could look into my eyes. Look now!"
{{ He(Eric John) }} did, and {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hands upon {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} shoulders trembled.
"No," {{ he(Eric John) }} said harshly. "You're a fool, {{ Ciaran(Thord) }}. Would you be as {{Otar}}, mad with what you have seen?"
"{{Otar}} is an old {{ man(Otar) }}, and likely crazed before {{ he(Otar) }} crossed the mountains. Besides—I am not {{Otar}}."
Stark said somberly, "Even the bravest may break. Ban Cruach {{ himself(Ban) }}...."
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} must have seen the shadow of that horror in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} eyes, for {{ he(Eric John) }} felt {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} body tense.
"What of Ban Cruach? What do you know, Stark? Tell me!"
{{ He(Eric John) }} was silent, and {{ she-opp(Thord) }} went from {{ him(Eric John) }} angrily.
"You have the talisman," {{ she-opp(Thord) }} said. "That I am sure of. And if need be, I will flay you alive to get it!" {{ She-opp(Thord) }} faced {{ him(Eric John) }} across the room. "But whether I get it or not, I will go through the Gates of Death. I must wait, now, until after the thaw. The warm wind will blow soon, and the gorges will be running full. But afterward, I will go, and no talk of fears and demons will stop me."
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} began to pace the room with long strides, and the full skirts of the gown made a subtle whispering about {{ her-opp(Thord) }}.
"You do not know," {{ she-opp(Thord) }} said, in a low and bitter voice. "I was a {{ girl-opp(Thord) }}-child, without a name. By the time I could walk, I was a servant in the house of my {{ grandfather(Thord) }}. The two things that kept me living were pride and hate. I left my scrubbing of floors to practice arms with the young {{ boy(Thord) }}s. I was beaten for it every day, but every day I went. I knew even then that only force would free me. And my {{ father(Thord) }} was a {{ king(Thord) }}'s {{ son(Thord) }}, a good {{ man(Thord) }} of {{ hisd(Thord) }} hands. {{ Hisd(Thord) }} blood was strong in me. I learned."
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} held {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} head very high. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} had earned the right to hold it so. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} finished quietly,
"I have come a long way. I will not turn back now."
"{{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}." Stark came and stood before {{ her-opp(Thord) }}. "I am talking to you as fighter, an equal. There may be power behind the Gates of Death, I do not know. But this I have seen—madness, horror, an evil that is beyond our understanding.
"I think you will not accuse me of cowardice. And yet I would not go into that pass for all the power of all the {{ king(Thord) }}s of Mars!"
Once started, {{ he(Eric John) }} could not stop. The full force of that dark vision of the talisman swept over {{ him(Eric John) }} again in memory. {{ He(Eric John) }} came closer to {{ her-opp(Thord) }}, driven by the need to make {{ her-opp(Thord) }} understand.
"Yes, I have the talisman! And I have had a taste of its purpose. I think Ban Cruach left it as a warning, so that none would follow {{ him(Ban) }}. I have seen the temples and the palaces glitter in the ice. I have seen the Gates of Death—not with my own eyes, {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}, but with {{ hisd(Ban) }}. With the eyes and the memories of Ban Cruach!"
{{ He(Eric-John) }} had caught {{ her-opp(Thord) }} again, {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hands strong on {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} strong arms.
"Will you believe me, or must you see for yourself—the dreadful things that walk those buried streets, the shapes that rise from nowhere in the mists of the pass?"
{{ Herd-opp(Thord) }} gaze burned into {{ his(Eric John) }}. {{ Herd-opp(Thord) }} breath was hot and sweet upon {{ hisd(Eric John) }} lips, and {{ she-opp(Thord) }} was like a sword between {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hands, shining and unafraid.
"Give me the talisman. Let me see!"
{{ He(Eric John) }} answered furiously, "You are mad. As mad as {{Otar}}." And {{ he(Eric John) }} kissed {{ her-opp(Thord) }}, in a rage, in a panic lest all that beauty be destroyed—a kiss as brutal as a blow, that left {{ him(Eric John) }} shaken.
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} backed away slowly, one step, and {{ he(Eric John) }} thought {{ she-opp(Thord) }} would have killed {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} said heavily:
"If you will see, you will. The thing is here."
{{ He(Eric John) }} opened the boss and laid the crystal in {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} outstretched hand. {{ He(Eric John) }} did not meet {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} eyes.
"Sit down. Hold the flat side against your brow."
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} sat, in a great chair of carven wood. Stark noticed that {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} hand was unsteady, {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} face the colour of white ash. {{ He(Eric John) }} was glad {{ she-opp(Thord) }} did not have the axe where {{ she-opp(Thord) }} could reach it. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} did not play at anger.
For a long moment {{ she-opp(Thord) }} studied the intricate lens, the incredible depository of a {{ man(Ban) }}'s mind. Then {{ she-opp(Thord) }} raised it slowly to {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} forehead.
{{ He(Eric John) }} saw {{ her-opp(Thord) }} grow rigid in the chair. How long {{ he(Eric John) }} watched beside {{ her-opp(Thord) }} {{ he(Eric John) }} never knew. Seconds, an eternity. {{ He(Eric John) }} saw {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} eyes turn blank and strange, and a shadow came into {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} face, changing it subtly, altering the lines, so that it seemed almost a stranger was peering through {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} flesh.
All at once, in a voice that was not {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} own, {{ she-opp(Thord) }} cried out terribly, "Oh gods of Mars!"
The talisman dropped rolling to the floor, and {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} fell forward into Stark's arms.
{{ He(Eric John) }} thought at first that {{ she-opp(Thord) }} was dead. {{ He(Eric John) }} carried {{ her-opp(Thord) }} to the bed, in an agony of fear that surprised {{ him(Eric John) }} with its violence, and laid {{ her-opp(Thord) }} down, and put {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hand over {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} heart.
It was beating strongly. Relief that was almost a sickness swept over {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} turned, searching vaguely for wine, and saw the talisman. {{ He(Eric John) }} picked it up and put it back inside the boss. A jewelled flagon stood on a table across the room. {{ He(Eric John) }} took it and started back, and then, abruptly, there was a wild clamor in the hall outside and {{Otar}} was shouting {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}'s name, pounding on the door.
It was not barred. In another moment they would burst through, and {{ he(Eric John) }} knew that they would not stop to enquire what {{ he(Eric John) }} was doing there.
{{ He(Eric John) }} dropped the flagon and went out swiftly, the way {{ he(Eric John) }} had come. The guard was still unconscious. In the narrow hall beyond, Stark hesitated. A {{ woman(Thanis) }}'s voice was rising high above the tumult in the main corridor, and {{ he(Eric John) }} thought {{ he(Eric John) }} recognized it.
{{ He(Eric John) }} went to the tapestry curtain and looked for the second time around its edge.
The lofty space was full of {{ men(Thord) }}, newly wakened from their heavy sleep and as nervous as so many bears. Thanis struggled in the grip of two of them. {{ Herd(Thanis) }} scarlet kirtle was torn, {{ herd(Thanis) }} hair flying in wild elf-locks, and {{ herd(Thanis) }} face was the face of a mad thing. The whole story of the doom of Kushat was written large upon it.
{{ She(Thanis) }} screamed again and again, and would not be silenced.
"Tell {{ her-opp(Thord) }}, the {{ witch-opp(Thord) }} that leads you! Tell {{ her-opp(Thord) }} that {{ she-opp(Thord) }} is already doomed to death, with all {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} army!"
{{Otar}} opened up the door of Ciara's room.
Thanis surged forward. {{ She(Thanis) }} must have fled through all that castle before {{ she(Thanis) }} was caught, and Stark's heart ached for {{ her(Thanis) }}.
"You!" {{ she(Thanis) }} shrieked through the doorway, and poured out all the filth of the quarter upon {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}'s name. "{{Balin}} has gone to bring doom upon you! {{ He(Balin) }} will open wide the Gates of Death, and then you will die!—die!—die!"
Stark felt the shock of a terrible dread, as {{ he(Eric John) }} let the curtain fall. Mad with hatred against conquerors, {{Balin}} had fulfilled {{ hisd(Balin) }} raging promise and had gone to fling open the Gates of Death.
Remembering {{ hisd(Eric John) }} nightmare vision of the shining, evil ones whom Ban Cruach had long ago prisoned beyond those gates, Stark felt a sickness grow within {{ him(Eric John) }} as {{ he(Eric John) }} went down the stair and out the postern door.
It was almost dawn. {{ He(Eric John) }} looked up at the brooding cliffs, and it seemed to {{ him(Eric John) }} that the wind in the pass had a sound of laughter that mocked {{ hisd(Eric John) }} growing dread.
{{ He(Eric John) }} knew what {{ he(Eric John) }} must do, if an ancient, mysterious horror was not to be released upon Kushat.
I may still catch {{Balin}} before {{ he(Balin) }} has gone too far! If I don't—
{{ He(Eric John) }} dared not think of that. {{ He(Eric John) }} began to walk very swiftly through the night streets, toward the distant, towering Gates of Death.
VII
It was past noon. {{ He(Eric John) }} had climbed high toward the saddle of the pass. Kushat lay small below {{ him(Eric John) }}, and {{ he(Eric John) }} could see now the pattern of the gorges, cut ages deep in the living rock, that carried the spring torrents of the watershed around the mighty ledge on which the city was built.
The pass itself was channeled, but only by its own snows and melting ice. It was too high for a watercourse. Nevertheless, Stark thought, a {{ man(Eric John) }} might find it hard to stay alive if {{ he(Eric John) }} were caught there by the thaw.
{{ He(Eric John) }} had seen nothing of {{Balin}}. The gods knew how many hours' start {{ he(Balin) }} had. Stark imagined {{ him(Eric John) }}, scrambling wild-eyed over the rocks, driven by the same madness that had sent Thanis up into the castle to call down destruction on Ciara's head.
The sun was brilliant but without warmth. Stark shivered, and the icy wind blew strong. The cliffs hung over {{ him(Eric John) }}, vast and sheer and crushing, and the narrow mouth of the pass was before {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} would go no farther. {{ He(Eric John) }} would turn back, now.
But {{ he(Eric John) }} did not. {{ He(Eric John }} began to walk forward, into the Gates of Death.
The light was dim and strange at the bottom of that cleft. Little veils of mist crept and clung between the ice and the rock, thickened, became more dense as {{ he(Eric John) }} went farther and farther into the pass. {{ He(Eric John) }} could not see, and the wind spoke with many tongues, piping in the crevices of the cliffs.
The steps of the Earth{{ man(Eric John) }} slowed and faltered. {{ He(Eric John) }} had known fear in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} life before. But now {{ he(Eric John) }} was carrying the burden of two soul's terrors—Ban Cruach's, and {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own.
{{ He(Eric John) }} stopped, enveloped in the clinging mist. {{ He(Eric John) }} tried to reason with {{ himself(Eric John) }}—that Ban Cruach's fears had died a million years ago, that{{Otar}} had come this way and lived, and {{Balin}} had come also.
But the thin veneer of civilization sloughed away and left {{ him(Eric John) }} with the naked bones of truth. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} nostrils twitched to the smell of evil, the subtle unclean taint that only a beast, or one as close to it as {{ he(Eric John) }}, can sense and know. Every nerve was a point of pain, raw with apprehension. An overpowering recognition of danger, hidden somewhere, mocking at {{ him(Eric John) }}, made {{ hisd(Eric John) }} very body change, draw in upon itself and flatten forward, so that when at last {{ he(Eric John) }} went on again {{ he(Eric John) }} was more like a four-footed thing than a {{ man(Eric John) }} walking upright.
Infinitely wary, silent, moving surely over the ice and the tumbled rock, {{ he(Eric John) }} followed {{Balin}}. {{ He(Eric John) }} had ceased to think. {{ He(Eric John) }} was going now on sheer instinct.
The pass led on and on. It grew darker, and in the dim uncanny twilight there were looming shapes that menaced {{ him(Eric John) }}, and ghostly wings that brushed {{ him(Eric John) }}, and a terrible stillness that was not broken by the eerie voices of the wind.
Rock and mist and ice. Nothing that moved or lived. And yet the sense of danger deepened, and when {{ he(Eric John) }} paused the beating of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} heart was like thunder in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} ears.
Once, far away, {{ he(Eric John) }} thought {{ he(Eric John) }} heard the echoes of a {{ man(Balin) }}'s voice crying, but {{ he(Eric John) }} had no sight of {{Balin}}.
The pass began to drop, and the twilight deepened into a kind of sickly night.
On and down, more slowly now, crouching, slinking, heavily oppressed, tempted to snarl at boulders and tear at wraiths of fog. {{ He(Eric John) }} had no idea of the miles {{ he(Eric John) }} had travelled. But the ice was thicker now, the cold intense.
The rock walls broke off sharply. The mist thinned. The pallid darkness lifted to a clear twilight. {{ He(Eric John) }} came to the end of the Gates of Death.
Stark stopped. Ahead of {{ him(Eric John) }}, almost blocking the end of the pass, something dark and high and massive loomed in the thinning mists.
It was a great cairn, and upon it sat a figure, facing outward from the Gates of Death as though it kept watch over whatever country lay beyond.
The figure of a {{ man(Ban) }} in antique Martian armor.
After a moment, Stark crept toward the cairn. {{ He(Eric John) }} was still almost all savage, torn between fear and fascination.
{{ He(Eric John) }} was forced to scramble over the lower rocks of the cairn itself. Quite suddenly {{ he(Eric John) }} felt a hard shock, and a flashing sensation of warmth that was somehow inside {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own flesh, and not in any tempering of the frozen air. {{ He(Eric John) }} gave a startled leap forward, and whirled, looking up into the face of the mailed figure with the confused idea that it had reached down and struck {{ him(Eric John) }}.
It had not moved, of course. And Stark knew, with no need of anyone to tell {{ him(Eric John) }}, that {{ he(Eric John) }} looked into the face of Ban Cruach.
It was a face made for battles and for ruling, the bony ridges harsh and strong, the hollows under them worn deep with years. Those eyes, dark shadows under the rusty helm, had dreamed high dreams, and neither age nor death had conquered them.
And even in death, Ban Cruach was not unarmed.
Clad as for battle in {{ hisd(Ban) }} ancient mail, {{ he(Ban) }} held upright between {{ hisd(Ban) }} hands a mighty sword. The pommel was a ball of crystal large as a fist, that held within it a spark of intense brilliance. The little, blinding flame throbbed with its own force, and the sword-blade blazed with a white, cruel radiance.
Ban Cruach, dead but frozen to eternal changelessness by the bitter cold, sitting here upon {{ hisd(Ban) }} cairn for a million years and warding forever the inner end of the Gates of Death, as {{ hisd(Ban) }} ancient city of Kushat warded the outer.
Stark took two cautious steps closer to Ban Cruach, and felt again the shock and the flaring heat in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} blood. {{ He(Eric John) }} recoiled, satisfied.
The strange force in the blazing sword made an invisible barrier across the mouth of the pass, protected Ban Cruach {{ himself(Ban) }}. A barrier of short waves, {{ he(Eric John) }} thought, of the type used in deep therapy, having no heat in themselves but increasing the heat in body cells by increasing their vibration. But these waves were stronger than any {{ he(Eric John) }} had known before.
A barrier, a wall of force, closing the inner end of the Gates of Death. A barrier that was not designed against people of Earth.
Stark shivered. {{ He(Eric John) }} turned from the sombre, brooding form of Ban Cruach and {{ hisd(Eric John) }} eyes followed the gaze of the dead {{ king(Ban) }}, out beyond the cairn.
{{ He(Eric John) }} looked across this forbidden land within the Gates of Death.
At {{ hisd(Eric John) }} back was the mountain barrier. Before {{ him(Eric John) }}, a handful of miles to the north, the terminus of the polar cap rose like a cliff of bluish crystal soaring up to touch the early stars. Locked in between those two titanic walls was a great valley of ice.
White and glimmering that valley was, and very still, and very beautiful, the ice shaped gracefully into curving domes and hollows. And in the center of it stood a dark tower of stone, a cyclopean bulk that Stark knew must go down an unguessable distance to its base on the bedrock. It was like the tower in which {{Camar}} had died. But this one was not a broken ruin. It loomed with alien arrogance, and within its bulk pallid lights flickered eerily, and it was crowned by a cloud of shimmering darkness.
It was like the tower of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} dread vision, the tower that {{ he(Eric John) }} had seen, not as {{Eric John}} Stark, but as Ban Cruach!
Stark's gaze dropped slowly from the evil tower to the curving ice of the valley. And the fear within {{ him(Eric John) }} grew beyond all bounds.
{{ He(Eric John) }} had seen that, too, in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} vision. The glimmering ice, the domes and hollows of it. {{ He(Eric John) }} had looked down through it at the city that lay beneath, and {{ he(Eric John) }} had seen those who came and went in the buried streets.
Stark hunkered down. For a long while {{ he(Eric John) }} did not stir.
{{ He(Eric John) }} did not want to go out there. {{ He(Eric John) }} did not want to go out from the grim, warning figure of Ban Cruach with {{ hisd(Ban) }} blazing sword, into that silent valley. {{ He(Eric John) }} was afraid, afraid of what {{ he(Eric John) }} might see if {{ he(Eric John) }} went there and looked down through the ice, afraid of the final dread fulfillment of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} vision.
But {{ he(Eric John) }} had come after {{Balin}}, and {{Balin}} must be out there somewhere. {{ He(Eric John) }} did not want to go, but {{ he(Eric John) }} was {{ himself(Eric John) }}, and {{ he(Eric John) }} must.
{{ He(Eric John) }} went, going very softly, out toward the tower of stone. And there was no sound in all that land.
The last of the twilight had faded. The ice gleamed, faintly luminous under the stars, and there was light beneath it, a soft radiance that filled all the valley with the glow of a buried moon.
Stark tried to keep {{ hisd(Eric John) }} eyes upon the tower. {{ He(Eric John) }} did not wish to look down at what lay under {{ hisd(Eric John) }} stealthy feet.
Inevitably, {{ he(Eric John) }} looked.
The temples and the palaces glittering in the ice....
Level upon level, going down. Wells of soft light spanned with soaring bridges, slender spires rising, an endless variation of streets and crystal walls exquisitely patterned, above and below and overlapping, so that it was like looking down through a thousand giant snowflakes. A metropolis of gossamer and frost, fragile and lovely as a dream, locked in the clear, pure vault of the ice.
Stark saw the people of the city passing along the bright streets, their outlines blurred by the icy vault as things are half obscured by water. The creatures of vision, vaguely shining, infinitely evil.
{{ He(Eric John) }} shut {{ hisd(Eric John) }} eyes and waited until the shock and the dizziness left {{ him(Eric John) }}. Then {{ he(Eric John) }} set {{ hisd(Eric John) }} gaze resolutely on the tower, and crept on, over the glassy sky that covered those buried streets.
Silence. Even the wind was hushed.
{{ He(Eric John) }} had gone perhaps half the distance when the cry rang out.
It burst upon the valley with a shocking violence. "Stark! Stark!" The ice rang with it, curving ridges picked up {{ hisd(Eric John) }} name and flung it back and forth with eerie crystal voices, and the echoes fled out whispering Stark! Stark! until it seemed that the very mountains spoke.
Stark whirled about. In the pallid gloom between the ice and the stars there was light enough to see the cairn behind {{ him(Eric John) }}, and the dim figure atop it with the shining sword.
Light enough to see {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}, and the dark knot of riders who had followed {{ her-opp(Thord) }} through the Gates of Death.
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} cried {{ hisd(Eric John) }} name again. "Come back! Come back!"
The ice of the valley answered mockingly, "Come back! Come back!" and Stark was gripped with a terror that held {{ him(Eric John) }} motionless.
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} should not have called {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} should not have made a sound in that deathly place.
A {{ man(Balin) }}'s hoarse scream rose above the flying echoes. The riders turned and fled suddenly, the squealing, hissing beasts crowding each other, floundering wildly on the rocks of the cairn, stampeding back into the pass.
{{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} was left alone. Stark saw {{ her-opp(Thord) }} fight the rearing beast {{ she-opp(Thord) }} rode and then flung {{ herself-opp(Thord) }} out of the saddle and let it go. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} came toward {{ him(Eric John) }}, running, clad all in {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} black armor, the great axe swinging high.
"Behind you, Stark! Oh, gods of Mars!"
{{ He(Eric John) }} turned then and saw them, coming out from the tower of stone, the pale, shining creatures that move so swiftly across the ice, so fleet and swift that no man or woman living could outrun them.
{{ He(Eric John) }} shouted to {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} to turn back. {{ He(Eric John) }} drew {{ hisd(Eric John) }} sword and over {{ hisd(Eric John) }} shoulder {{ he(Eric John) }} cursed {{ her-opp(Thord) }} in a black fury because {{ he(Eric John) }} could hear {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} mailed feet coming on behind {{ him(Eric John) }}.
The gliding creatures, sleek and slender, reedlike, bending, delicate as wraiths, their bodies shaped from northern rainbows of amethyst and rose—if they should touch {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}, if their loathsome hands should touch {{ her-opp(Thord) }}....
Stark let out one raging catlike scream, and rushed them.
The opalescent bodies slipped away beyond {{ hisd(Eric John) }} reach. The creatures watched {{ him(Eric John) }}.
They had no faces, but they watched. They were eyeless but not blind, earless, but not without hearing. The inquisitive tendrils that formed their sensory organs stirred and shifted like the petals of ungodly flowers, and the color of them was the white frost-fire that dances on the snow.
"Go back, {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}!"
But {{ she-opp(Thord) }} would not go, and {{ he(Eric John) }} knew that they would not have let {{ her-opp(Throd) }}. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} reached {{ him(Eric John) }}, and they set their backs together. The shining ones ringed them round, many feet away across the ice, and watched the long sword and the great hungry axe, and there was something in the lissome swaying of their bodies that suggested laughter.
"You fool," said Stark. "You bloody fool."
"And you?" answered {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}. "Oh, yes, I know about {{Balin}}. That mad {{ girl(Thanis) }}, screaming in the palace—{{ she(Thanis) }} told me, and you were seen from the wall, climbing to the Gates of Death. I tried to catch you."
"Why?"
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} did not answer that. "They won't fight us, Stark. Do you think we could make it back to the cairn?"
"No. But we can try."
Guarding each others' backs, they began to walk toward Ban Cruach and the pass. If they could once reach the barrier, they would be safe.
Stark knew now what Ban Cruach's wall of force was built against. And {{ he(Eric John) }} began to guess the riddle of the Gates of Death.
The shining ones glided with them, out of reach. They did not try to bar the way. They formed a circle around {{Eric John}} and {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}, moving with them and around them at the same time, an endless weaving chain of many bodies shining with soft jewel tones of color.
They drew closer and closer to the cairn, to the brooding figure of Ban Cruach and {{ hisd(Ban) }} sword. It crossed Stark's mind that the creatures were playing with {{ him(Eric John) }} and {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}. Yet they had no weapons. Almost, {{ he(Eric John) }} began to hope....
From the tower where the shimmering cloud of darkness clung came a black crescent of force that swept across the ice-field like a sickle and gathered the two people in.
Stark felt a shock of numbing cold that turned {{ hisd(Eric John) }} nerves to ice. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} sword dropped from {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hand, and {{ he(Eric John) }} heard {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}'s axe go down. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} body was without strength, without feeling, dead.
{{ He(Eric John) }} fell, and the shining ones glided in toward {{ him(Eric John) }}.
VIII
Twice before in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} life Stark had come near to freezing. It had been like this, the numbness and the cold. And yet it seemed that the dark force had struck rather at {{ hisd(Eric John) }} nerve centers than at {{ hisd(Eric John) }} flesh.
{{ He(Eric John) }} could not see {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}, who was behind {{ him(Eric John) }}, but {{ he(Eric John) }} heard the metallic clashing of {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} mail and one small, whispered cry, and {{ he(Eric John) }} knew that {{ she-opp(Thord) }} had fallen, too.
The glowing creatures surrounded {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} saw their bodies bending over {{ him(Eric John) }}, the frosty tendrils of their faces writhing as though in excitement or delight.
Their hands touched {{ him(Eric John) }}. Little hands with seven fingers, deft and frail. Even {{ hisd(Eric John) }} numbed flesh felt the terrible cold of their touch, freezing as outer space. {{ He(Eric John) }} yelled, or tried to, but they were not abashed.
They lifted {{ him(Eric John) }} and bore {{ him(Eric John) }} toward the tower, a company of them, bearing {{ hisd(Eric John) }} heavy weight upon their gleaming shoulders.
{{ He(Eric John) }} saw the tower loom high and higher still above {{ him(Eric John) }}. The cloud of dark force that crowned it blotted out the stars. It became too huge and high to see at all, and then there was a low flat arch of stone close above {{ hisd(Eric John) }} face, and {{ he(Eric John) }} was inside.
Straight overhead—a hundred feet, two hundred, {{ he(Eric John) }} could not tell—was a globe of crystal, fitted into the top of the tower as a jewel is held in a setting.
The air around it was shadowed with the same eerie gloom that hovered outside, but less dense, so that Stark could see the smouldering purple spark that burned within the globe, sending out its dark vibrations.
A globe of crystal, with a heart of sullen flame. Stark remembered the sword of Ban Cruach, and the white fire that burned in its hilt.
Two globes, the bright-cored and the dark. The sword of Ban Cruach touched the blood with heat. The globe of the tower deadened the flesh with cold. It was the same force, but at opposite ends of the spectrum.
Stark saw the cryptic controls of that glooming globe—a bank of them, on a wide stone ledge just inside the tower, close beside {{ him(Eric John) }}. There were shining ones on that ledge tending those controls, and there were other strange and massive mechanisms there too.
Flying spirals of ice climbed up inside the tower, spanning the great stone well with spidery bridges, joining icy galleries. In some of those galleries, Stark vaguely glimpsed rigid, gleaming figures like statues of ice, but {{ he(Eric John) }} could not see them clearly as {{ he(Eric John) }} was carried on.
{{ He(Eric John) }} was being carried downward. {{ He(Eric John) }} passed slits in the wall, and knew that the pallid lights {{ he(Eric John) }} had seen through them were the moving bodies of the creatures as they went up and down these high-flung, icy bridges. {{ He(Eric John) }} managed to turn {{ hisd(Eric John) }} head to look down, and saw what was beneath {{ him(Eric John) }}.
The well of the tower plunged down a good five hundred feet to bedrock, widening as it went. The web of ice-bridges and the spiral ways went down as well as up, and the creatures that carried {{ him(Eric John) }} were moving smoothly along a transparent ribbon of ice no more than a yard in width, suspended over that terrible drop.
Stark was glad that {{ he(Eric John) }} could not move just then. One instinctive start of horror would have thrown {{ him(Eric John) }} and {{ hisd(Eric John) }} bearers to the rock below, and would have carried {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} with them.
Down and down, gliding in utter silence along the descending spiral ribbon. The great glooming crystal grew remote above {{ him(Eric John) }}. Ice was solid now in the slots of the walls. {{ He(Eric John) }} wondered if they had brought {{Balin}} this way.
There were other openings, wide arches like the one they had brought their captives through, and these gave Stark brief glimpses of broad avenues and unguessable buildings, shaped from the pellucid ice and flooded with the soft radiance that was like eerie moonlight.
At length, on what Stark took to be the third level of the city, the creatures bore {{ him(Eric John) }} through one of these archways, into the streets beyond.
Below {{ him(Eric John) }} now was the translucent thickness of ice that formed the floor of this level and the roof of the level beneath. {{ He(Eric John) }} could see the blurred tops of delicate minarets, the clustering roofs that shone like chips of diamond.
Above {{ him(Eric John) }} was an ice roof. Elfin spires rose toward it, delicate as needles. Lacy battlements and little domes, buildings star-shaped, wheel-shaped, the fantastic, lovely shapes of snow-crystals, frosted over with a sparkling foam of light.
The people of the city gathered along the way to watch, a living, shifting rainbow of amethyst and rose and green, against the pure blue-white. And there was no least whisper of sound anywhere.
For some distance they went through a geometric maze of streets. And then there was a cathedral-like building all arched and spired, standing in the center of a twelve-pointed plaza. Here they turned, and bore their captives in.
Stark saw a vaulted roof, very slim and high, etched with a glittering tracery that might have been carving of an alien sort, delicate as the weavings of spiders. The feet of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} bearers were silent on the icy paving.
At the far end of the long vault sat seven of the shining ones in high seats marvellously shaped from the ice. And before them, grey-faced, shuddering with cold and not noticing it, drugged with a sick horror, stood {{Balin}}. {{ He(Balin) }} looked around once, and did not speak.
Stark was set on {{ hisd(Eric John) }} feet, with {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} beside {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} saw {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} face, and it was terrible to see the fear in {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} eyes, that had never shown fear before.
{{ He(Eric John) }} {{ himself(Eric John) }} was learning why people went mad beyond the Gates of Death.
Chill, dreadful fingers touched {{ him(Eric John) }} expertly. A flash of pain drove down {{ hisd(Eric John) }} spine, and {{ he(Eric John) }} could stand again.
The seven who sat in the high seats were motionless, their bright tendrils stirring with infinite delicacy as though they studied the three humans who stood before them.
Stark thought {{ he(Eric John) }} could feel a cold, soft fingering of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} brain. It came to {{ him(Eric John) }} that these creatures were probably telepaths. They lacked organs of speech, and yet they must have some efficient means of communications. Telepathy was not uncommon among the many races of the Solar System, and Stark had had experience with it before.
{{ He(Eric John) }} forced {{ hisd(Eric John) }} mind to relax. The alien impulse was instantly stronger. {{ He(Eric John) }} sent out {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own questing thought and felt it brush the edges of a consciousness so utterly foreign to {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own that {{ he(Eric John) }} knew {{ he(Eric John) }} could never probe it, even had {{ he(Eric John) }} had the skill.
{{ He(Eric John) }} learned one thing—that the shining faceless ones looked upon {{ him(Eric John) }} with equal horror and loathing. They recoiled from the unnatural human features, and most of all, most strongly, they abhorred the warmth of human flesh. Even the infinitesimal amount of heat radiated by their half-frozen human bodies caused the ice-folk discomfort.
Stark marshalled {{ hisd(Eric John) }} imperfect abilities and projected a mental question to the seven.
"What do you want of us?"
The answer came back, faint and imperfect, as though the gap between their alien minds was almost too great to bridge. And the answer was one word.
"Freedom!"
{{Balin}} spoke suddenly. {{ He(Balin) }} voiced only a whisper, and yet the sound was shockingly loud in that crystal vault.
"They have asked me already. Tell them no, Stark! Tell them no!"
{{ He(Eric John) }} looked at {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} then, a look of murderous hatred. "If you turn them loose upon Kushat, I will kill you with my own hands before I die."
Stark spoke again, silently, to the seven. "I do not understand."
Again the struggling, difficult thought. "We are the old race, the {{ king(Thord) }}s of the glacial ice. Once we held all the land beyond the mountains, outside the pass you call the Gates of Death."
Stark had seen the ruins of the towers out on the moors. {{ He(Eric John) }} knew how far their kingdom had extended.
"We controlled the ice, far outside the polar cap. Our towers blanketed the land with the dark force drawn from Mars itself, from the magnetic field of the planet. That radiation bars out heat, from the Sun, and even from the awful winds that blow warm from the south. So there was never any thaw. Our cities were many, and our race was great.
"Then came Ban Cruach, from the south....
"{{ He(Ban) }} waged a war against us. {{ He(Ban) }} learned the secret of the crystal globes, and learned how to reverse their force and use it against us. {{ He(Ban) }}, leading {{ hisd(Ban) }} army, destroyed our towers one by one, and drove us back....
"Mars needed water. The outer ice was melted, our lovely cities crumbled to nothing, so that creatures like Ban Cruach might have water! And our people died.
"We retreated at the last, to this our ancient polar citadel behind the Gates of Death. Even here, Ban Cruach followed. {{ He(Ban) }} destroyed even this tower once, at the time of the thaw. But this city is founded in polar ice—and only the upper levels were harmed. Even Ban Cruach could not touch the heart of the eternal polar cap of Mars!
"When {{ he(Ban) }} saw that {{ he(Ban) }} could not destroy us utterly, {{ he(Ban) }} set {{ himself(Ban) }} in death to guard the Gates of Death with {{ hisd(Ban) }} blazing sword, that we might never again reclaim our ancient dominion.
"That is what we mean when we ask for freedom. We ask that you take away the sword of Ban Cruach, so that we may once again go out through the Gates of Death!"
Stark cried aloud, hoarsely, "No!"
{{ He(Eric John) }} knew the barren deserts of the south, the wastes of red dust, the dead sea bottoms—the terrible thirst of Mars, growing greater with every year of the million that had passed since Ban Cruach locked the Gates of Death.
{{ He(Eric John) }} knew the canals, the pitiful waterways that were all that stood between the people of Mars and extinction. {{ He(Eric John) }} remembered the yearly release from death when the spring thaw brought the water rushing down from the north.
{{ He(Eric John) }} thought of these cold creatures going forth, building again their great towers of stone, sheathing half a world in ice that would never melt. {{ He(Eric John) }} thought of the people of Jekkara and Valkis and Barrakesh, of the countless cities of the south, watching for the flood that did not come, and falling at last to mingle their bodies with the blowing dust.
{{ He(Eric John) }} said again, "No. Never."
The distant thought-voice of the seven spoke, and this time the question was addressed to {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}.
Stark saw {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} face. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} did not know the Mars {{ he(Eric John) }} knew, but {{ she-opp(Thord) }} had memories of {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} own—the mountain-valleys of Mekh, the moors, the snowy gorges. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} looked at the shining ones in their high seats, and said,
"If I take that sword, it will be to use it against you as Ban Cruach did!"
Stark knew that the seven had understood the thought behind {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} words. {{ He(Eric John) }} felt that they were amused.
"The secret of that sword was lost a million years ago, the day Ban Cruach died. Neither you nor anyone now knows how to use it as {{ he(Ban) }} did. But the sword's radiations of warmth still lock us here.
"We cannot approach that sword, for its vibrations of heat slay us if we do. But you warm-bodied ones can approach it. And you will do so, and take it from its place. One of you will take it!"
They were very sure of that.
"We can see, a little way, into your evil minds. Much we do not understand. But—the mind of the large {{ man(Eric John) }} is full of the {{ woman-opp(Thord) }}'s image, and the mind of the {{ woman-opp(Thord) }} turns to {{ him(Eric John) }}. Also, there is a link between the large {{ man(Eric John) }} and the small {{ man(Balin) }}, less strong, but strong enough."
The thought-voice of the seven finished, "The large {{ man(Eric John) }} will take away the sword for us because {{ he(Eric John) }} must—to save the other two."
{{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} turned to Stark. "They cannot force you, Stark. Don't let them. No matter what they do to me, don't let them!"
{{Balin}} stared at {{ her-opp(Thord) }} with a certain wonder. "You would die, to protect Kushat?"
"Not Kushat alone, though its people too are human," {{ she-opp(Thord) }} said, almost angrily. "There are my red wolves—a wild pack, but my own. And others." {{ She-opp(Thord) }} looked at {{Balin}}. "What do you say? Your life against the Norlands?"
{{Balin}} made an effort to lift {{ hisd(Balin) }} head as high as {{ hers-opp(Thord) }}, and the red jewel flashed in {{ hisd(Balin) }} ear. {{ He(Balin) }} was a {{ man(Balin) }} crushed by the falling of {{ hisd(Balin) }} world, and terrified by what {{ hisd(Balin) }} mad passion had led {{ him(Balin) }} into, here beyond the Gates of Death. But {{ he(Balin) }} was not afraid to die.
{{ He(Balin) }} said so, and even {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} knew that {{ he(Balin) }} spoke the truth.
But the seven were not dismayed. Stark knew that when their thought-voice whispered in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} mind,
"It is not death alone you humans have to fear, but the manner of your dying. You shall see that, before you choose."
Swiftly, silently, those of the ice-folk who had borne the captives into the city came up from behind, where they had stood withdrawn and waiting. And one of them bore a crystal rod like a sceptre, with a spark of ugly purple burning in the globed end.
Stark leaped to put {{ himself(Eric John) }} between them and {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} struck out, raging, and because {{ he(Eric John) }} was almost as quick as they, {{ he(Eric John) }} caught one of the slim luminous bodies between {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hands.
The utter coldness of that alien flesh burned {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hands as frost will burn. Even so, {{ he(Eric John) }} clung on, snarling, and saw the tendrils writhe and stiffen as though in pain.
Then, from the crystal rod, a thread of darkness spun itself to touch {{ hisd(Eric John) }} brain with silence, and the cold that lies between the worlds.
{{ He(Eric John) }} had no memory of being carried once more through the shimmering streets of that elfin, evil city, back to the stupendous well of the tower, and up along the spiral path of ice that soared those dizzy hundreds of feet from bedrock to the glooming crystal globe. But when {{ he(Eric John) }} again opened {{ hisd(Eric John) }} eyes, {{ he(Eric John) }} was lying on the wide stone ledge at ice-level.
Beside {{ him(Eric John) }} was the arch that led outside. Close above {{ hisd(Eric John) }} head was the control bank that {{ he(Eric John) }} had seen before.
{{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} and {{Balin}} were there also, on the ledge. They leaned stiffly against the stone wall beside the control bank, and facing them was a squat, round mechanism from which projected a sort of wheel of crystal rods.
Their bodies were strangely rigid, but their eyes and minds were awake. Terribly awake. Stark saw their eyes, and {{ hisd(Eric John) }} heart turned within {{ him(Eric John) }}.
{{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} looked at {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} could not speak, but {{ she-opp(Thord) }} had no need to. No matter what they do to me....
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} had not feared the swordsmen of Kushat. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} had not feared {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} red wolves, when {{ he(Eric John) }} unmasked {{ her-opp(Thord) }} in the square. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} was afraid now. But {{ she-opp(Thord) }} warned {{ him(Eric John) }}, ordered {{ him(Eric John) }} not to save {{ her-opp(Thord) }}.
They cannot force you. Stark! Don't let them.
And {{Balin}}, too, pleaded with {{ him(Eric John) }} for Kushat.
They were not alone on the ledge. The ice-folk clustered there, and out upon the flying spiral pathway, on the narrow bridges and the spans of fragile ice, they stood in hundreds watching, eyeless, faceless, their bodies drawn in rainbow lines across the dimness of the shaft.
Stark's mind could hear the silent edges of their laughter. Secret, knowing laughter, full of evil, full of triumph, and Stark was filled with a corroding terror.
{{ He(Eric John) }} tried to move, to crawl toward {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} standing like a carven image in {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} black mail. {{ He(Eric John) }} could not.
Again {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} fierce, proud glance met {{ his(Eric John) }}. And the silent laughter of the ice-folk echoed in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} mind, and {{ he(Eric John) }} thought it very strange that in this moment, now, {{ he(Eric John) }} should realize that there had never been another {{ woman-opp(Thord) }} like {{ her-opp(Thord) }} on all of the worlds of the Sun.
The fear {{ she-opp(Thord) }} felt was not for {{ herself-opp(Thord) }}. It was for {{ him(Eric John) }}.
Apart from the multitudes of the ice-folk, the group of seven stood upon the ledge. And now their thought-voice spoke to Stark, saying,
"Look about you. Behold the humans who have come before you through the Gates of Death!"
Stark raised {{ hisd(Eric John) }} eyes to where their slender fingers pointed, and saw the icy galleries around the tower, saw more clearly the icy statues in them that {{ he(Eric John) }} had only glimpsed before.
Men and women, set like images in the galleries. People whose bodies were sheathed in a glittering mail of ice, sealing them forever. Warriors, nobles, fanatics and thieves—the wanderers of a million years who had dared to enter this forbidden valley, and had remained forever.
{{ He(Eric John) }} saw their faces, their tortured eyes wide open, their features frozen in the agony of a slow and awful death.
"They refused us," the seven whispered. "They would not take away the sword. And so they died, as this {{ woman-opp(Thord) }} and this {{ man(Balin) }} will die, unless you choose to save them.
"We will show you, human, how they died!"
One of the ice-folk bent and touched the squat, round mechanism that faced {{Balin}} and {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}. Another shifted the pattern of control on the master-bank.
The wheel of crystal rods on that squat mechanism began to turn. The rods blurred, became a disc that spun faster and faster.
High above in the top of the tower the great globe brooded, shrouded in its cloud of shimmering darkness. The disc became a whirling blur. The glooming shadow of the globe deepened, coalesced. It began to lengthen and descend, stretching itself down toward the spinning disc.
The crystal rods of the mechanism drank the shadow in. And out of that spinning blur there came a subtle weaving of threads of darkness, a gossamer curtain winding around {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} and {{Balin}} so that their outlines grew ghostly and the pallor of their flesh was as the pallor of snow at night.
And still Stark could not move.
The veil of darkness began to sparkle faintly. Stark watched it, watched the chill motes brighten, watched the tracery of frost whiten over {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}'s mail, touch Balin's dark hair with silver.
Frost. Bright, sparkling, beautiful, a halo of frost around their bodies. A dust of splintered diamond across their faces, an aureole of brittle light to crown their heads.
Frost. Flesh slowly hardening in marbly whiteness, as the cold slowly increased. And yet their eyes still lived, and saw, and understood.
The thought-voice of the seven spoke again.
"You have only minutes now to decide! Their bodies cannot endure too much, and live again. Behold their eyes, and how they suffer!
"Only minutes, human! Take away the sword of Ban Cruach! Open for us the Gates of Death, and we will release these two, alive."
Stark felt again the flashing stab of pain along {{ hisd(Eric John) }} nerves, as one of the shining creatures moved behind {{ him(Eric John) }}. Life and feeling came back into {{ hisd(Eric John) }} limbs.
{{ He(Eric John) }} struggled to {{ hisd(Eric John) }} feet. The hundreds of the ice-folk on the bridges and galleries watched {{ him(Eric John) }} in an eager silence.
{{ He(Eric John) }} did not look at them. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} eyes were on {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}'s. And now, {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} eyes pleaded.
"Don't, Stark! Don't barter the life of the Norlands for me!"
The thought-voice beat at Stark, cutting into {{ hisd(Eric John) }} mind with cruel urgency.
"Hurry, human! They are already beginning to die. Take away the sword, and let them live!"
Stark turned. {{ He(Eric John) }} cried out, in a voice that made the icy bridges tremble:
"I will take the sword!"
{{ He(Eric John) }} staggered out, then. Out through the archway, across the ice, toward the distant cairn that blocked the Gates of Death.
IX
Across the glowing ice of the valley Stark went at a stumbling run that grew swifter and more sure as {{ hisd(Eric John) }} cold-numbed body began to regain its functions. And behind {{ him(Eric John) }}, pouring out of the tower to watch, came the shining ones.
They followed after {{ him(Eric John) }}, gliding lightly. {{ He(Eric John) }} could sense their excitement, the cold, strange ecstasy of triumph. {{ He(Eric John) }} knew that already they were thinking of the great towers of stone rising again above the Norlands, the crystal cities still and beautiful under the ice, all vestige of the ugly citadels of humankind gone and forgotten.
The seven spoke once more, a warning.
"If you turn toward us with the sword, the {{ woman-opp(Thord) }} and the small {{ man(Balin) }} will die. And you will die as well. For neither you nor any other can now use the sword as a weapon of offense."
Stark ran on. {{ He(Eric John) }} was thinking then only of {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}, with the frost-crystals gleaming on {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} marble flesh and {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} eyes full of mute torment.
The cairn loomed up ahead, dark and high. It seemed to Stark that the brooding figure of Ban Cruach watched {{ him(Eric John) }} coming with those shadowed eyes beneath the rusty helm. The great sword blazed between those dead, frozen hands.
<br />
The great sword blazed between those dead, frozen hands....
The ice-folk had slowed their forward rush. They stopped and waited, well back from the cairn.
Stark reached the edge of tumbled rock. {{ He(Eric John) }} felt the first warm flare of the force-waves in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} blood, and slowly the chill began to creep out from {{ hisd(Eric John) }} bones. {{ He(Eric John) }} climbed, scrambling upward over the rough stones of the cairn.
Abruptly, then, at Ban Cruach's feet, {{ he(Eric John) }} slipped and fell. For a second it seemed that {{ he(Eric John) }} could not move.
{{ Hisd(Eric John) }} back was turned toward the ice-folk. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} body was bent forward, and shielded so, {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hands worked with feverish speed.
From {{ hisd(Eric John) }} cloak {{ he(Eric John) }} tore a strip of cloth. From the iron boss {{ he(Eric John) }} took the glittering lens, the talisman of Ban Cruach. Stark laid the lens against {{ hisd(Eric John) }} brow, and bound it on.
The remembered shock, the flood and sweep of memories that were not {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own. The mind of Ban Cruach thundering its warning, its hard-won knowledge of an ancient, epic war....
{{ He(Eric John) }} opened {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own mind wide to receive those memories. Before {{ he(Eric John) }} had fought against them. Now {{ he(Eric John) }} knew that they were {{ hisd(Eric John) }} one small chance in this swift gamble with death. Two things only of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own {{ he(Eric John) }} kept firm in that staggering tide of another {{ man(Ban) }}'s memories. Two names—{{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} and Balin.
{{ He(Eric John) }} rose up again. And now {{ hisd(Eric John) }} face had a strange look, a curious duality. The features had not changed, but somehow the lines of the flesh had altered subtly, so that it was almost as though the old unconquerable {{ king(Ban) }} {{ himself(Ban) }} had risen again in battle.
{{ He(Eric John) }} mounted the last step or two and stood before Ban Cruach. A shudder ran through {{ him(Eric John) }}, a sort of gathering and settling of the flesh, as though Stark's being had accepted the stranger within it. {{ Hisd(Eric John) }} eyes, cold and pale as the very ice that sheathed the valley, burned with a cruel light.
{{ He(Eric John) }} reached and took the sword, out of the frozen hands of Ban Cruach.
As though it were {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own, {{ he(Eric John) }} knew the secret of the metal rings that bound its hilt, below the ball of crystal. The savage throb of the invisible radiation beat in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} quickening flesh. {{ He(Eric John) }} was warm again, {{ hisd(Eric John) }} blood running swiftly, {{ hisd(Eric John) }} muscles sure and strong. {{ He(Eric John) }} touched the rings and turned them.
The fan-shaped aura of force that had closed the Gates of Death narrowed in, and as it narrowed it leaped up from the blade of the sword in a tongue of pale fire, faintly shimmering, made visible now by the full focus of its strength.
Stark felt the wave of horror bursting from the minds of the ice-folk as they perceived what {{ he(Eric John) }} had done. And {{ he(Eric John) }} laughed.
{{ Hisd(Eric John) }} bitter laughter rang harsh across the valley as {{ he(Eric John) }} turned to face them, and {{ he(Eric John) }} heard in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} brain the shuddering, silent shriek that went up from all that gathered company....
"Ban Cruach! Ban Cruach has returned!"
They had touched {{ hisd(Eric John) }} mind. They knew.
{{ He(Eric John) }} laughed again, and swept the sword in a flashing arc, and watched the long bright blade of force strike out more terrible than steel, against the rainbow bodies of the shining ones.
They fell. Like flowers under a scythe they fell, and all across the ice the ones who were yet untouched turned about in their hundreds and fled back toward the tower.
Stark came leaping down the cairn, the talisman of Ban Cruach bound upon {{ hisd(Eric John) }} brow, the sword of Ban Cruach blazing in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hand.
{{ He(Eric John) }} swung that awful blade as {{ he(Eric John) }} ran. The force-beam that sprang from it cut through the press of creatures fleeing before {{ him(Eric John) }}, hampered by their own numbers as they crowded back through the archway.
{{ He(Eric John) }} had only a few short seconds to do what {{ he(Eric John) }} had to do.
Rushing with great strides across the ice, spurning the withered bodies of the dead.... And then, from the glooming darkness that hovered around the tower of stone, the black cold beam struck down.
Like a coiling whip it lashed {{ him(Eric John) }}. The deadly numbness invaded the cells of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} flesh, ached in the marrow of {{ hisd(Eric John) }} bones. The bright force of the sword battled the chill invaders, and a corrosive agony tore at Stark's inner body where the antipathetic radiations waged war.
{{ Hisd(Eric John) }} steps faltered. {{ He(Eric John) }} gave one hoarse cry of pain, and then {{ hisd(Eric John) }} limbs failed and {{ he(Eric John) }} went heavily to {{ hisd(Eric John) }} knees.
Instinct only made {{ him(Eric John) }} cling to the sword. Waves of blinding anguish racked {{ him(Eric John) }}. The coiling lash of darkness encircled {{ him(Eric John) }}, and its touch was the abysmal cold of outer space, striking deep into {{ hisd(Eric John) }} heart.
Hold the sword close, hold it closer, like a shield. The pain is great, but I will not die unless I drop the sword.
Ban Cruach the mighty had fought this fight before.
Stark raised the sword again, close against {{ hisd(Eric John) }} body. The fierce pulse of its brightness drove back the cold. Not far, for the freezing touch was very strong. But far enough so that {{ he(Eric John) }} could rise again and stagger on.
The dark force of the tower writhed and licked about {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} could not escape it. {{ He(Eric John) }} slashed it in a blind fury with the blazing sword, and where the forces met a flicker of lightning leaped in the air, but it would not be beaten back.
{{ He(Eric John) }} screamed at it, a raging cat-cry that was all Stark, all primitive fury at the necessity of pain. And {{ he(Eric John) }} forced {{ himself(Eric John) }} to run, to drag {{ hisd(Eric John) }} tortured body faster across the ice. Because {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} is dying, because the dark cold wants me to stop....
The ice-folk jammed and surged against the archway, in a panic hurry to take refuge far below in their many-levelled city. {{ He(Eric John) }} raged at them, too. They were part of the cold, part of the pain. Because of them {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} and {{Balin}} were dying. {{ He(Eric John) }} sent the blade of force lancing among them, {{ hisd(Eric John) }} hatred rising full tide to join the hatred of Ban Cruach that lodged in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} mind.
Stab and cut and slash with the long terrible beam of brightness. They fell and fell, the hideous shining folk, and Stark sent the light of Ban Cruach's weapon sweeping through the tower itself, through the openings that were like windows in the stone.
Again and again, stabbing through those open slits as {{ he(Eric John) }} ran. And suddenly the dark beam of force ceased to move. {{ He(Eric John) }} tore out of it, and it did not follow {{ him(Eric John) }}, remaining stationary as though fastened to the ice.
The battle of forces left {{ hisd(Eric John) }} flesh. The pain was gone. {{ He(Eric John) }} sped on to the tower.
{{ He(Eric John) }} was close now. The withered bodies lay in heaps before the arch. The last of the ice-folk had forced their way inside. Holding the sword level like a lance, Stark leaped in through the arch, into the tower.
The shining ones were dead where the destroying warmth had touched them. The flying spiral ribbons of ice were swept clean of them, the arching bridges and the galleries of that upper part of the tower.
They were dead along the ledge, under the control bank. They were dead across the mechanism that spun the frosty doom around {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} and {{Balin}}. The whirling disc still hummed.
Below, in that stupendous well, the crowding ice-folk made a seething pattern of color on the narrow ways. But Stark turned {{ hisd(Eric John) }} back on them and ran along the ledge, and in {{ him(Eric John) }} was the heavy knowledge that {{ he(Eric John) }} had come too late.
The frost had thickened around {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} and Balin. It encrusted them like stiffened lace, and now their flesh was overlaid with a diamond shell of ice.
Surely they could not live!
{{ He(Eric John) }} raised the sword to smite down at the whirring disc, to smash it, but there was no need. When the full force of that concentrated beam struck it, meeting the focus of shadow that it held, there was a violent flare of light and a shattering of crystal. The mechanism was silent.
The glooming veil was gone from around the ice-shelled small {{ man(Balin) }} and {{ woman-opp(Thord) }}. Stark forgot the creatures in the shaft below {{ him(Eric John) }}. {{ He(Eric John) }} turned the blazing sword full upon {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} and Balin.
It would not affect the thin covering of ice. If the {{ woman-opp(Thord) }} and the small {{ man(Balin) }} were dead, it would not affect their flesh, any more than it had Ban Cruach's. But if they lived, if there was still a spark, a flicker beneath that frozen mail, the radiation would touch their blood with warmth, start again the pulse of life in their bodies.
{{ He(Eric John) }} waited, watching {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}'s face. It was still as marble, and as white.
Something—instinct, or the warning mind of Ban Cruach that had learned a million years ago to beware the creatures of the ice—made {{ him(Eric John) }} glance behind {{ him(Eric John) }}.
Stealthy, swift and silent, up the winding ways they came. They had guessed that {{ he(Eric John) }} had forgotten them in {{ hisd(Eric John) }} anxiety. The sword was turned away from them now, and if they could take {{ him(Eric John) }} from behind, stun {{ him(Eric John) }} with the chill force of the sceptre-like rods they carried....
{{ He(Eric John) }} slashed them with the sword. {{ He(Eric John) }} saw the flickering beam go down and down the shaft, saw the bodies fall like drops of rain, rebounding here and there from the flying spans and carrying the living with them.
{{ He(Eric John) }} thought of the many levels of the city. {{ He(Eric John) }} thought of all the countless thousands that must inhabit them. {{ He(Eric John) }} could hold them off in the shaft as long as {{ he(Eric John) }} wished if {{ he(Eric John) }} had no other need for the sword. But {{ he(Eric John) }} knew that as soon as {{ he(Eric John) }} turned {{ hisd(Eric John) }} back they would be upon {{ him(Eric John) }} again, and if {{ he(Eric John) }} should once fall....
{{ He(Eric John) }} could not spare a moment, or a chance.
{{ He(Eric John) }} looked at {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}, not knowing what to do, and it seemed to {{ him(Eric John) }} that the sheathing frost had melted, just a little, around {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} face.
Desperately, {{ he(Eric John) }} struck down again at the creatures in the shaft, and then the answer came to {{ him(Eric John) }}.
{{ He(Eric John) }} dropped the sword. The squat, round mechanism was beside {{ him(Eric John) }}, with its broken crystal wheel. {{ He(Eric John) }} picked it up.
It was heavy. It would have been heavy for two to lift, but Stark was a driven {{ man(Eric John) }}. Grunting, swaying with the effort, {{ he(Eric John) }} lifted it and let it fall, out and down.
Like a thunderbolt it struck among those slender bridges, the spiderweb of icy strands that spanned the shaft. Stark watched it go, and listened to the brittle snapping of the ice, the final crashing of a million shards at the bottom far below.
{{ He(Eric John) }} smiled, and turned again to {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}, picking up the sword.
It was hours later. Stark walked across the glowing ice of the valley, toward the cairn. The sword of Ban Cruach hung at {{ hisd(Eric John) }} side. {{ He(Eric John) }} had taken the talisman and replaced it in the boss, and {{ he(Eric John) }} was {{ himself(Eric John) }} again.
{{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} and {{Balin}} walked beside {{ him(Eric John) }}. The color had come back into their faces, but faintly, and they were still weak enough to be glad of Stark's hands to steady them.
At the foot of the cairn they stopped, and Stark mounted it alone.
{{ He(Eric John) }} looked for a long moment into the face of Ban Cruach. Then {{ he(Eric John) }} took the sword, and carefully turned the rings upon it so that the radiation spread out as it had before, to close the Gates of Death.
Almost reverently, {{ he(Eric John) }} replaced the sword in Ban Cruach's hands. Then {{ he(Eric John) }} turned and went down over the tumbled stones.
The shimmering darkness brooded still over the distant tower. Underneath the ice, the elfin city still spread downward. The shining ones would rebuild their bridges in the shaft, and go on as they had before, dreaming their cold dreams of ancient power.
But they would not go out through the Gates of Death. Ban Cruach in {{ hisd(Ban) }} rusty mail was still {{ lord(Ban) }} of the pass, the warder of the Norlands.
Stark said to the others, "Tell the story in Kushat. Tell it through the Norlands, the story of Ban Cruach and why {{ he(Ban) }} guards the Gates of Death. Humans have forgotten. And they should not forget."
They went out of the valley then, the three of them. They did not speak again, and the way out through the pass seemed endless.
Some of {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}'s chieftains met them at the mouth of the pass above Kushat. They had waited there, ashamed to return to the city without {{ her-opp(Thord) }}, but not daring to go back into the pass again. They had seen the creatures of the valley, and they were still afraid.
They gave mounts to the three. They themselves walked behind {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}, and their heads were low with shame.
They came into Kushat through the riven gate, and Stark went with {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} to the {{ King(Thord) }} City, where {{ she-opp(Thord) }} made {{Balin}} follow too.
"Your {{ sister(Thanis&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;) }} is there," {{ she-opp(Thord) }} said. "I have had {{ her(Thanis) }} cared for."
The city was quiet, with the sullen apathy that follows after battle. The {{ men(Thord) }} of Mekh cheered {{ Ciaran(Thord) }} in the streets. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} rode proudly, but Stark saw that {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} face was gaunt and strained.
{{ He(Eric John) }}, too, was marked deep by what {{ he(Eric John) }} had seen and done, beyond the Gates of Death.
They went up into the castle.
Thanis took {{Balin}} into {{ herd(Thanis) }} arms, and wept. {{ She(Thanis) }} had lost {{ herd(Thanis) }} first wild fury, and {{ she(Thanis) }} could look at {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} now with a restrained hatred that had a tinge almost of admiration.
"You fought for Kushat," {{ she(Thanis) }} said, unwillingly, when {{ she(Thanis) }} had heard the story. "For that, at least, I can thank you."
{{ She(Thanis) }} went to Stark then, and looked up at {{ him(Eric John) }}. "Kushat, and my {{ brother(Balin) }}'s life...." {{ She(Thanis) }} kissed {{ him(Eric John) }}, and there were tears on {{ herd(Thanis) }} lips. But {{ she(Thanis) }} turned to {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} with a bitter smile.
"No one can hold {{ him(Eric John) }}, any more than the wind can be held. You will learn that."
{{ She(Thanis) }} went out then with {{Balin}}, and left Stark and {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} alone, in the chambers of the {{ king(Thord) }}.
{{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} said, "The little one is very shrewd." {{ She-opp(Thord) }} unbuckled the hauberk and let it fall, standing slim in {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} tunic of black leather, and walked to the tall windows that looked out upon the mountains. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} leaned {{ herd-opp(Thord) }} head wearily against the stone.
"An evil day, an evil deed. And now I have Kushat to govern, with no reward of power from beyond the Gates of Death. How humans can be misled!"
Stark poured wine from the flagon and brought it to {{ her-opp(Thord) }}. {{ She-opp(Thord) }} looked at {{ him(Eric John) }} over the rim of the cup, with a certain wry amusement.
"The little one is shrewd, and {{ she(Thanis) }} is right. I don't know that I can be as wise as {{ she(Thanis) }}.... Will you stay with me, Stark, or will you go?"
{{ He(Eric John) }} did not answer at once, and {{ she-opp(Thord) }} asked {{ him(Eric John) }}, "What hunger drives you, Stark? It is not conquest, as it was with me. What are you looking for that you cannot find?"
{{ He(Eric John) }} thought back across the years, back to the beginning—to the {{ boy(Eric John) }} N'Chaka who had once been happy with Old One and little Tika, in the blaze and thunder and bitter frosts of a valley in the Twilight Belt of Mercury. {{ He(Eric John) }} remembered how all that had ended, under the guns of the miners—the men and women who were {{ hisd(Eric John) }} own kind.
{{ He(Eric John) }} shook {{ hisd(Eric John) }} head. "I don't know. It doesn't matter." {{ He(Eric John) }} took {{ her-opp(Thord) }} between {{ hisd(Eric John) }} two hands, feeling the strength and the splendor of {{ her-opp(Thord) }}, and it was oddly difficult to find words.
"I want to stay, {{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }}. Now, this minute, I could promise that I would stay forever. But I know myself. You belong here, you will make Kushat your own. I don't. Someday I will go."
{{ Ciaran-opp(Thord) }} nodded. "My neck, also, was not made for chains, and one country was too little to hold me. Very well, Stark. Let it be so."
{{ She-opp(Thord) }} smiled, and let the wine-cup fall.
