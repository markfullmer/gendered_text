R. {{ANDREW}} McCRAE, the news editor of the Morning Glow, frowned thoughtfully at the slip of paper before {{ him(Andrew) }} and took the telephone receiver from its stand.
“{{Mr(Bat)}}. Miller in the office?” {{ he(Andrew) }} asked sharply. “Send {{ him(Bat) }} up.”
Almost before {{ he(Andrew) }} had replaced the instrument, the door opened and there entered a well-groomed, swarthy-complexioned {{ man(Bat) }} of about two and thirty, with aquiline features and bright, restless eyes. {{ His(Bat) }} hair, which {{ he(Bat) }} wore rather long and parted in the middle, was jet-black and hung straight, as though {{ he(Bat) }} had just emerged from a bath.
{{Bat}} Miller was an American. One knew that as soon as {{ he(Bat) }} opened {{ his(Bat) }} month. In the office they sometimes called {{ him(Bat) }} “The Sioux,” and there was undoubtedly Indian blood in {{ his(Bat) }} veins. {{ He(Bat) }} now stood silently watching {{ his(Bat) }} chief.
“{{Bat}}, here’s a job for you,” said the great {{ man(Andrew) }}. “I think you’ll like it.”
{{ He(Andrew) }} spoke as though it was not a matter of great moment whether {{Bat}} liked it or not. {{ He(Andrew) }} had to do it, anyway.
The American took the slip of paper tendered to {{ him(Bat) }} and read what was on it, apparently at a glance. It was a matter of common knowledge that {{Bat}} Miller could walk into a room and, after one swift look round, go away and write an absolutely complete inventory of its contents. {{ He(Bat) }} returned the paper.
“Case of skipped with the dough,” said {{ he(Bat) }} laconically.
{{ Mr.(Andrew) }} McCrae frowned.
{{ He(Andrew) }} rather objected to {{ his(Andrew) }} star reporter’s free-and-easy Americanisms, but {{Bat }}was a valuable {{ man(Bat) }}, and {{ his(Bat) }} eccentricities had to be condoned.
“Yes; this {{ Mr.(Ralph) }} {{Ralph}} Freemantle, secretary of the Weizerboom Cycle Company, has apparently absconded with a good share of their money,” {{ he(Andrew) }} returned with a slight severity of tone which was quite lost upon {{Bat}}.
“I don’t expect you to find {{ him(Ralph) }}. {{ He(Ralph) }} is probably half-way across Europe by this time. You see, {{ he(Ralph) }} has had twenty-four hours’ start.
“But I want you to get the details. How much {{ he(Ralph) }} has taken—how {{ he(Ralph) }} got in as secretary; for I may tell you the police suspect {{ him(Ralph) }} to be what I suppose you would call a ‘swell crook’; and there’s a {{ woman(Leon) }} in it somewhere, of course.” {{ Mr.(Andrew) }} McCrae was single and thought little of  {{ women(Leon) }}.
“Get some sort of story here by midnight at the latest. It is eight now. You have four hours. I’ll hold half a column for you—all I can spare.”
{{Bat }} considered for a moment.
“I suppose it’s a sure thing that the guy has flitted?” {{ he(Bat) }} asked.
{{ Mr.(Andrew) }} McCrae tapped the paper impatiently.
“Doesn’t this say the police have been hunting {{ him(Ralph) }} since midday?” {{ he(Andrew) }} retorted.
{{Bat}} nodded.
“I’ll pull out right away,” said {{ he(Bat) }}. “No; I don’t want that paper. I’ve got it all in my dome.”
{{ Mr.(Andrew) }} McCrae’s face relaxed for a moment.
“There, now,” {{ he(Andrew) }} mused; “any of the other reporters would be whereing and whoing me crazy before they got off the mark. I will say that for {{Bat}}; {{ he(Bat) }} is quick on the uptake. {{ He(Bat) }}’ll fill that half-column, all right. Maybe I’d better make it three-quarters.”
And {{ he(Andrew) }} proceeded to cut down a two thousand word report of a fire— which an over-enthusiastic correspondent had sent up from the provinces—to a three-line paragraph.
{{Bat}} Miller at once made {{ his(Bat) }} way to the premises of the Weizerboom Cycle Company, in Holborn, and presented {{ his(peBatrson) }} card as representative of the Morning Glow. A dried-up little {{ man(manager) }} with a worried expression received {{ him(Bat) }}.
“What! Another of you?” {{ he(manager) }} exclaimed irritably, rumpling {{ his(manager) }} scanty hair. “Lord! there is nothing fresh to tell, beyond that the deficit seems rather bigger than was anticipated—nearer four thousand than three, the figure we put it at first. There’s a {{ man(accountant) }} here from Hearder & Dean, the accountants, going through the books now.”
“How’s {{ he(Ralph) }} got it—cash?” asked Bat.
“Drew the whole lot from the bank— Universal Deposit—Clapham Branch— yesterday morning. Altered a check after it had been signed by one of the directors and myself. {{ He(Ralph) }} wrote the check itself originally, so it was easy for {{ him(Ralph) }}.”
“But {{ he(Ralph) }} couldn’t have taken it all in coin.”
The manager made a grimace.
“Oh, but {{ he(Ralph) }} did! Had a taxicab waiting. Preached them up some yarn about a big sum wanted for extra wages at our works in Birmingham. We have had occasion to draw fairly large sums in coin before now, you see, though not quite as much as that, and it seemed O. K. to the bank people.
“Besides, there was the check, genuine enough. It took them half an hour to get it together, and the fellow waited as calm as a cucumber, barring -{{ he(Ralph) }} said {{ he(Ralph) }} hadn’t much time to catch the train.”
“Got a picture of {{ him(Ralph) }}?” inquired {{Bat}}.
The manager laughed grimly. “{{His(Ralph)}} drawer was full of ‘em,” {{ he(manager) }} replied. “The Dawn people have had one; here’s one for you.”
{{Bat}} Miller scrutinized the portrait. It represented a {{ man(Ralph) }} of apparently about thirty, with clear-cut features and dark curly hair carefully waved over the forehead.
“Very indiscreet of {{ him(Ralph) }} to leave these things round,” commented the American. “Looks like some sort of stage guy.”
“Oh, {{ he(Ralph) }}’s all that! Great {{ man(Ralph) }} at comic songs and so on. I dare say that’s what brought {{ him(Ralph) }} down, getting in with a sporty set; no good to any young {{ man(Ralph) }}, that sort of thing.”
“True,” said {{Bat}} gravely. {{ He(Bat) }} {{ himself(Bat) }} was as rank a Bohemian as existed in London.
“But I understand that the police believe {{ him(Ralph) }} to be a well-known crook.”
The manager snorted contemptuously.
“The police!” {{ he(manager) }} exclaimed. “I dare say! They must say something. {{ His(Ralph) }} references were of the best, confound {{ him(Ralph) }}!”
“Where is {{ his(Ralph) }} little nest, anyway?” asked {{Bat}}. “{{He(Ralph)}} didn’t live here on the premises, I take it.”
“Maythorn Villa, Lombardy Road. Lee,” was the reply. “But that has been overhauled. You’ll only find {{ his(Ralph) }} {{housekeeper(Gates)}} there waiting for about three months’ back salary. I guess {{ she(Gates) }}’ll have to wait.”
“You’ve been there?”
“With the police, this morning,” replied the manager, who was beginning to show a querulous impatience.
“And there is no clue to this Freemantle’s whereabouts?”
“None whatever, and now you really must excuse me. I have told you all I know. Oh, yes; take the photo by all means. It may help to track the rascal, if your people publish it.”
{{Bat}} carefully placed the photograph in {{ his(Bat) }} pocketbook.
“Thanks,” said {{ he(Bat) }} pleasantly. “I hope the crook’ll get pinched with the goods on {{ him(Ralph) }}, or within calling distance, at any rate. Good night.”
“Good night,” replied the other absently.
{{Bat}} slowly descended the stairs.
“Lee,” {{ he(Bat) }} muttered—“that’s south side. I guess I’ll go there, though I dare say that little runt up-stairs is right; there won’t be anything in it. Still—who knows!”
{{ He(Bat) }} was fortunate enough to catch a train at Cannon Street immediately, and after half an hour’s run alighted at the high and windy station of Lee. {{ He(Bat) }} found Maythorn Villa to be a semi-detached residence, built of dingy white brick; one of a couple of dozen, all exactly alike, overlooking some nursery-gardens. A small terrier barked noisily as {{ he(Bat) }} opened the gate.
“Didn’t take {{ his(Ralph) }} pup with {{ him(Ralph) }}, anyway,” muttered {{Bat}}.
{{ He(Bat) }} rang the bell and glanced round speculatively. {{ He(Bat) }} knew that even modest little semi-detached houses within half an hour’s ride of the city were not to be had for nothing. {{ He(Bat) }} {{ himself(Bat) }} had to be content with a couple of rooms in the north of London. The shrubbery was well kept, too, and by the light of a lamp just outside the gate {{ he(Bat) }} saw that the drive had been newly graveled.
The door opened and an elderly {{ woman(Gates) }} stood regarding {{ him(Bat) }} inquiringly through {{ her(Gates) }} spectacles. {{ She(Gates) }} was soberly attired in a dress of some dark material with a white cap bearing a touch of heliotrope on one side. This was the {{housekeeper(Gates)}}, no doubt. But Miller raised {{ his(Bat) }} hat.
“This is {{ Mr.(Ralph) }} Freemantle’s, I believe?” said {{ he(Bat) }}.
“Yes, sir; but {{ he(Ralph) }} is not in now.”
“No, so I understand,” replied {{Bat}} dryly. “You will see by this that I am a representative of the Morning Glow newspaper.”
The {{ woman(Gates) }} took the card. {{ Her(Gates) }} hand trembled and {{ she(Gates) }} spoke agitatedly.
“Yes. Of course you know what has happened. Oh, {{sir(Bat)}}, it is a dreadful thing! I— I—”
Unable to say more, {{ she(Gates) }} turned away with a little sob.
Bat knit {{ his(Bat) }} brows. {{ He(Bat) }} hated to see women cry.
“May I come in?” {{ he(Bat) }} said quietly. “I promise not to trouble you more than is absolutely necessary.”
The housekeeper recovered {{ herself(Gates) }} and turned to {{ him(Bat) }} again.
“Excuse me, sir,” {{ she(Gates) }} said apologetically. “I have known {{ Mr.(Ralph) }} Freemantle from a {{ child(Ralph) }}. I worked for the family since {{ he(Ralph) }} was a baby, and I feel this very deeply indeed. Come in if you must, but I assure you I can tell you nothing beyond what I suppose you know already.”
{{ She(Gates) }} led {{Bat}} into a drawing-room furnished with lavish taste, not to say extravagance. Photographs of various stage characters occupied a good deal of space on the walls, but there were many pictures which {{Bat}}’s quick eye told {{ him(Bat) }} were of considerable value.
Though the room was crowded with mostly knickknacks, {{ he(Bat) }} observed that the top of the piano was clear of ornaments—a fact which showed that musical enthusiasm had reigned supreme. A bright fire glowed in the grate.
“I keep it lighted, {{sir(Bat)}},” said the {{ woman(Gates) }} with a pathetic little break in {{ her(Gates) }} voice, “in case {{ he(Bat) }} should come back. Perhaps it is all a mistake, after all! Who knows? I cannot believe it of {{ him(Bat) }} yet.”
{{Bat}} shook {{ his(Bat) }} head as {{ he(Bat) }} sat down in one of the huge easy chairs, while the {{housekeeper(Gates)}} took a stiff-backed one and smoothed out {{ her(Gates) }} dark {{skirt(Gates)}} in front of {{ her(Gates) }}.
“I am afraid there is small chance of that,” said {{ he(Bat) }}. “You see, {{ he(Ralph) }} cashed a check for an amount far beyond what it was originally made out for. Unhappily the thing is clear enough.”
The {{ woman(Gates) }} nodded sadly. “Ah, yes, the police told me,” {{ she(Gates) }} replied, “when they came and searched the house this afternoon. Of course I don’t understand much about that. I never interested myself in {{ his(Ralph) }} business affairs. I only knew {{ he(Ralph) }} seemed to be doing well.”
“Yes,” returned {{Bat}}, glancing round; “he doesn’t seem to have been living in what you may call penury. {{ He(Ralph) }} occupied this house alone?”
“Yes—-besides myself and a servant {{ girl(Leon) }}.”
“Any relatives?”
“He has no one in the world. Both {{ his(Ralph) }} parents died when {{ he(Ralph) }} was very young. I have lived with {{ him(Ralph) }} for nearly seven years—six in Birmingham and the remainder here. We had only been here nine months.”
Bat questioned {{ her(Gates) }} further and {{ she(Gates) }} answered freely. {{ Her(Gates) }} own name was Gates— {{Mrs.(Gates}} Gates. {{ Her(Gates) }} spouse had been killed in an accident eight years before. {{ Mr.(Ralph) }} Freemantle appeared to have lived a comfortable bachelor-life of quite a normal kind.
An occasional trip to Brighton or Scarborough, with two or three jaunts farther afield, to Paris, Brussels, and one summer to Switzerland, had formed {{ his(Ralph) }} only lengthy absences.
{{ He(Ralph }} was very fond of theatergoing, and had at one time spoken of going on the regular stage {{ himself(Ralph) }}. {{ He(Ralph) }} belonged to two amateur societies—one solely dramatic and the other operatic, for {{ he(Ralph) }} had a very good singing voice.
Bat Miller’s eyes roamed round the room.
“I suppose these are some of {{ him(Ralph) }} in various characters,” said {{ he(Ralph) }}.
“Yes,” replied {{Mrs.(Gates)}} Gates; but {{ she(Gates) }} seemed disinclined to talk further of {{ her(Gates) }} {{master(Ralph)}}’s stage experiences; and, from the slightly disapproving tone in which {{ she(Gates) }} spoke of them, {{Bat}} suspected {{ her(Gates) }} of Puritanical tendencies.
“Well, I am very much obliged to you, {{ma’am(Gates)}},” said {{ he(Bat) }}. “I have taken up considerable time, and you ought to be paid for it. It isn’t as though I had an absolute right.”
{{ He(Bat) }} placed half a sovereign on the little ormolu table at {{ his(Bat) }} elbow. {{Mrs.(Gates)}} Gates raised {{ her(Gates) }} hand deprecatingly.
“Oh, it isn’t my money,” said {{Bat}} laughingly. “Our people like to pay for their stuff, you know.”
The {{ woman(Gates) }} sighed.
“It is very kind of you, sir,” {{ she(Gates) }} said: “and I will not deny that it is very acceptable to me. I am sure I don’t know what I shall do now,” and {{ she(Gates) }} choked back another sob.
“Oh, but all this will be sold up, of course,” said {{Bat}}, indicating the luxurious surroundings; “and if I know anything, it will go far toward making good what has been taken, unless—” {{Bat }} added as a sudden thought struck {{ him(Bat) }}.
{{Mrs.(Gates)}}  Gates shook {{ her(Gates)}} head.
“It’s all hired. Except the photographs, of course—and the people are coming to fetch it away in the morning. They would have done so, anyway. There has never been anything paid beyond the first instalment.”
“Phew!” whistled {{Bat}}. “I might have guessed that. {{ He(Bat) }} seems rather a versatile sort of crook, this—”
{{ He(Bat) }} checked {{ himself(Bat) }} suddenly at the look of pain on {{ his(Bat) }} companion’s face and looked at {{ his(Bat) }} watch.
“There is no train back to the city for over an hour,” said {{ he(Bat) }}. “I’d like to write up my stuff here if I may. That waiting-room up at the depot is no boudoir. It’s warmer here.”
“Certainly, sir,” said {{Mrs.(Gates)}} Gates; though {{Bat}} thought {{ he(Bat) }} detected a certain note of reluctance.
“Thank you,” said {{ he(Bat) }}. “I’ll be no trouble— just a couple of square feet of table room, that’s all I want.”
As the {{housekeeper(Gates)}} turned to leave the room {{ her(Gates) }} {{skirt(Gates)}} caught in a little table and a vase standing thereon toppled over.
{{ She(Gates) }} caught it deftly and, murmuring something apologetic, moved the whole affair to a corner.
{{Bat}} Miller stiffened suddenly and drew in {{ his(Bat) }} breath with a half-smothered gasp. Then {{ he(Bat) }} recovered {{ himself(Bat) }} with lightning-like rapidity, though {{ his(Bat) }} eyes glittered behind the half-closed lids.
“By the way, I’ll want to step down to the post-office to send my people a wire,” said {{ he(Bat) }}.
“Very well, sir; it is quite near. I will leave the door ajar, so that you can come right in on your return.”
“Just so—many thanks,” replied {{Bat}}, apparently deep in {{ his(Bat) }} note-book.
The {{ woman(Gates) }} left the room. {{Bat}} closed {{ his(Bat) }} book with a snap and, first seeing that the door was closed, walked round the room with {{ his(Bat) }} peculiar catlike tread, scrutinizing the portraits on the wall. Then {{ he(Bat) }} drew out the photograph {{ he(Bat) }} had procured in Holburn and gazed at it for some moments.
“Sure—it’s a cinch,” {{ he(Bat) }} murmured.
{{ His(Bat) }} eyes were brighter than ever and {{ his(Bat) }} rather wide mouth set in a straight line. {{ He(Bat) }} opened the door and left the room with a swift, noiseless movement. As {{ he(Bat) }} did so {{ he(Bat) }} caught sight of a {{feminine(Leon)}} form vanishing through another door.
“So the help hasn’t left the sinking ship, either,” {{ he(Bat) }} muttered. “I wonder—old McCrae may be right—”
{{ He(Bat) }} walked to the post-office deep in thought, though {{ his(Bat) }} senses were on the alert for what happened round {{ him(Bat) }}, and {{ he(Bat) }} knew that {{ he(Bat) }} was not being followed. No one ever did that unknown to {{Bat}} Miller {{ himself(Bat) }}.
“Hold full column—good story,” {{ he(Bat) }} wired the Glow. Then {{ he(Bat) }} sent another telegram elsewhere of a somewhat more urgent character, the wording of which made the {{ girl(Molly) }} look up at {{ him(Bat) }} curiously when {{ she(Molly) }} had read it.
Bat held up an admonitory forefinger. “Not a word to anybody,” said {{ he(Bat) }}, with playful severity. The {{ girl(Molly) }} tossed {{ her(Molly) }} head.
“I know my duties,” {{ she(Molly) }} retorted.
“I guess you do,” said {{Bat}} calmly, “Send ’em by the quick wire, {{Molly}}— there’s a peach.”
On {{ his(Bat) }} return {{ he(Bat) }} found the front door half open. {{Bat}} grinned.
“Bluff’s a good policy sometimes,” {{ he(Bat) }} said softly.
“But I’ll make sure. I’ve come back, {{Mrs.(Gates)}} Gates!” {{ he(Bat)}} sung out.
“All right, {{sir(Bat)}}; I heard you.”
“You bet,” muttered {{Bat}}.
“My watch has gone wrong,” {{ he(Bat) }} continued. “The blamed thing has stopped dead—heart, I guess. Will you kindly tell me when it is- half past nine?”
“Certainly, {{sir(Bat)}}.” {{Mrs.(Gates)}} Gates had come into the hall and was placidly regarding {{ him(Bat) }} through {{ her(Gates) }} glasses, which glowed blood-red in the light of the hall-lamp.
“By the way,” said {{Bat}}, “I’m sorry to be a nuisance, but would you mind letting your help bring me a cup of coffee and a couple of biscuits. I haven’t had anything to eat since two o’clock.”
The {{housekeeper(Gates)}} frowned slightly.
“Help?” {{ she(Gates) }} said interrogatively.
Bat laughed. “Your servant, I mean.” {{ he(Bat) }} explained. “We call them ‘helps’ in the States. I’m American, you know, and haven’t quite learned the British language yet.”
{{Mrs.(Gates)}} Gates’s face did not relax. “The {{ girl(Leon) }} has left,” {{ she(Gates) }} observed; “but I will bring you what you require with pleasure.”
“Left, has {{ she(Gates) }}?” exclaimed {{Bat}}. “That’s rough on you. Well, if you will be so kind.” {{ He(Bat) }} passed into the drawing-room.
“I oughtn’t to have let on,” {{ he(Bat) }} mused. “That bit of josh of mine might easily ruin everything. {{Bat}}, you’re some idiot.”
{{Mrs.(Gates)}} Gates brought {{ his(Bat) }} coffee and biscuits, but {{ her(Gates) }} manner had changed, and {{Bat}} cursed {{ himself(Bat) }} fluently under {{ his(Bat)}} breath.
Left to {{ himself(Bat) }}, {{ he(Bat) }} carefully poured the coffee into the pot of a tall palm which adorned one corner of the room.
“I’m not taking any chances in the doping line,” {{ he(Bat) }} muttered.
For half an hour {{ he(Bat) }} wrote steadily, consulting the watch {{ he(Bat) }} had libeled at frequent intervals. At last there came a tap at the door.
{{Bat}} chuckled softly. “Ten minutes before time,” {{ he(Bat) }} said to {{ himself(Bat) }}. “No overdoing the hospitality stunt. Well, I reckon I’ve made allowance.”
“Come in!” {{ he(Bat) }} cried, and as {{ he(Bat) }} spoke {{ he(Bat) }} carefully drew {{ his(Bat) }} loose papers over something on the table before {{ him(Bat) }}.
The {{housekeeper(Gates)}}  stood in the doorway. “Half past nine, sir,” {{ she(Gates) }} said respectfully.
“Already?” cried {{Bat}}. “Well, I’m about through. Come in, {{ma’am(Gates)}}, for a minute, will you? There are just one or two more points I’d like to ask about.”
{{Mrs.(Gates)}} Gate’s looked at {{ him(Bat) }} strangely and advanced into the room with evident hesitation.
Bat rose and, gliding behind {{ her(person) }}, closed the door. {{ He(Bat) }} also turned the key and withdrew it.
So rapid were {{ his(Bat) }} movements that {{ he(Bat) }} was back again with the table between them were {{Mrs.(Gates)}} Gates could speak. But {{ her(Gates) }} quick ear had caught the noise of the key, slight as it had been.
“What are you doing?” {{ she(Gates) }} cried sharply, and Bat noted a sudden change in {{ her(Gates) }} voice. {{ He(Bat) }} eyed {{ her(Gates) }} with a quizzical expression.
“{{Sonny(Ralph)}}, the jig’s up,” said {{ he(Bat) }} quietly.
{{Mrs.(Gates)}} Gates’s face paled and {{ her(Gates) }} figure stiffened.
“What—what do you mean?” {{ she(Gates) }} replied in a voice strangely hoarse and unsteady. “Who are you—a robber ?”
{{Bat}} smiled and shook {{ his(Bat) }} head.
“Oh, you Willie!” said {{ he(Bat) }}. “It won’t do! I’m on to you! Do you get me? Take off that gray lid of yours and smile—no, you don’t, you rattler!”
The {{housekeeper(Gates)}}, livid with rage and desperation, had seized a chair and held it high in the air. In another moment it would have crashed down on {{Bat}}’s head, but {{ he(Bat) }} swept {{ his(Bat) }} papers aside and raised the revolver which {{ he(Bat) }} had ready.
“Drop the furniture!” {{ he(Bat) }} said sharply. “It’s on the hire system, and you’ve no right to smash it.”
The chair was lowered, and two smoldering eyes glared at {{ him(Bat) }} in impotent fury.
“That’s right,” said {{Bat}} genially. “Don’t let’s have a rough house. You see, it’s no good. I have wired the police and a couple of cops are about due—now, then, you fool!”
At the mention of police {{ his(Bat) }} captive had made for the door and was banging at it frantically with {{ his(Gates) }} fists.
“{{Leonie}}—{{Leonie}}—the police are here— save yourself!” {{ he(Ralph) }} cried. There was no attempt at the mellow {{contralto(Gates)}} voice now, and a {{man(Ralph)}ly {{baritone(Ralph)}} carried the words throughout the house.
“Oh, {{Leonie}}, is it?” said {{Bat}}. “Well, I’m afraid {{Leonie}}’s got the lemon this time. Ah— yes, I thought so.”
A tigerish scream rang out, mingled with the gruff voices of men.
“They’re roping {{Leonie}},” commented {{Bat}} Miller. “Now, they’ll add you to the collection—ah, would you?”
Apparently maddened by the sound of the {{ woman(Loen) }}’s voice, the disguised {{ man(Ralph) }} sprang at {{ his(Ralph) }} captor and tried to wrest {{ his(Bat) }} revolver from {{ him(Bat) }}, but {{Bat}} Miller’s muscles were like whipcord.
In a moment the frenzied {{ man(Ralph) }} lay dazedly on {{ his(Ralph) }} back, the gray wig awry, disclosing a bullet-head of close-cropped black hair beneath.
“Now, that’s too bad,” said {{Bat}} regretfully. “I wanted to show you up in full canonicals. If you hadn’t got peeved I reckon we’d have had some fun. I’d have introduced you to the sleuths as Charley’s {{Aunt(Gates)}} from Dudville—ha, here we are!”
{{ He(Bat) }} broke off as a thunderous knock came at the door.
Leaving {{ his(Bat) }} prisoner on the floor with a numbed arm, {{Bat}} thrust in the key and threw open the door, admitting two burly but rather ruffled-looking detectives, one of whom had a handkerchief roughly tied round {{ his(police) }} hand.
{{Bat}} waved {{ his(Bat) }} hand airily. “Officers” said {{ he(Bat) }}, “allow me to present you to {{ Mr.(Ralph) }} {{Ralph}} Freemantle in {{ his(Ralph) }} star part, the old {{lady(Gates)}} of the Grange. {{ He(Ralph) }} will now take a call. I don’t think {{ he(Ralph) }}’ll give you any Swedish exercises. I believe I shook {{ him(Ralph) }} up some just now.”
The figure on the floor looked comical enough, in spite of the bloodshot eyes which shot baleful glances up at them: but the men did not smile.
“{{He(Ralph)}}’d better come quiet,” said the one with the wounded hand grimly, “or I’ll feel inclined to pay {{ him(Ralph) }} back for the trouble that tiger-cat of a {{ woman(Leon) }} of {{ his(Ralph) }} gave us. {{ She(Leon) }} nearly bit my hand in two.”
“But you didn’t let {{ her(Leon) }} slip?” asked {{Bat}}.
“Constable has {{ her(Leon) }} all right below, sir, with the bracelets on.”
“Ah!” sighed {{Bat}}, “that’s no way to treat a {{lady(Leon); but I suppose you’ll say {{ladies(Leon)}} don’t make meals off police officer’s hands. You’ve a couple of taxis, have you? Well, I’ll just pinch a ride on one. May as well finish up a pleasant evening in style.”

“You see,” said {[Bat}} Miller, as {{ he(Bat) }} sat in the office, later on, smoking a seven-inch Havana, “I never got wise until our sport caught that flower-jug so neat. No old {{ woman(Gates) }} could have done it just like that.
“Then, once being on the track, the photographs did the rest. {{ He(Ralph) }} was a fool to leave them about. That’s the way with all these smart crooks that always slip a cog sooner or later, and being something of a good-looker, vanity was {{ his(Ralph) }} rock. That wasn’t a bad idea to make the piano the treasure chest, though you’d look for notes rather than bullion in a thing of that sort.”
{{Bat}} paused for the expected laugh, but {{ his(Andrew) }} long-drawn face was as immovable as stone, and nobody showed appreciation of {{ his(Bat) }} joke.
{{Bat}} sighed softly. “That double-identity stunt was a cute game enough, too,” {{ he(Bat) }} continued.
“Whoever would have guessed that the old {{dame(Gates)}} who kept house there all those months was the bright-eyed {{ boy(Ralph) }} {{ himself(Ralph) }}? If I hadn’t tumbled, they would have cleared out next day, cash and all, with no more notice being taken than if they were two mud-spots on a wheel.
“Nobody ever remarked upon the fact that Freemantle and {{ his(Ralph) }} ‘old-folks-at-home’ {{housekeeper (Gates)}} were never on view at the same time. That {{Leonie}} was some peach, too; though after the rough and tumble with the sleuths {{ she(Leonie) }} looked more like {{Calamity Jane(Leon)}} from ’way back. A biter from Biteville! Gee! I’m glad I only had to deal with the {{male(Ralph)}} bird, though {{ he(Ralph) }}’d have put me out o’ commission if I’d given {{ him(Ralph) }} half a chance.
“Oh, yes; the Weizerboom people have promised to decorate me some. I’ll ask you all to supper at one of the big grub emporiums up West when it comes off. But what galls me is that old Mac only gave me a column.
“Why, with a bunch of those photos to light up the sermon, I could have filled half a page at least.”
