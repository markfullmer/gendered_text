<h1>The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}'s New Clothes</h1>
<h2>By Hans Chistian Anderson</h2>

<h3>Published 1837. Original Text from Project Gutenberg.</h3>

Many years ago there was an {{Emperor}}, who was so excessively fond of new clothes that {{ he(Emperor) }} spent all {{ hisd(Emperor) }} money on them. {{ He(Emperor) }} cared nothing about {{ hisd(Emperor) }} soldiers, nor for the theatre, nor for driving in the woods except for the sake of showing off {{ hisd(Emperor) }} new clothes. {{ He(Emperor) }} had a costume for every hour in the day, and instead of saying, as one does about any other {{ king(Emperor) }} or {{ emperor(Emperor) }}, '{{ He(Emperor) }} is in {{ hisd(Emperor) }} council chamber,' here one always said, 'The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} is in {{ hisd(Emperor) }} dressing-room.'
Life was very gay in the great town where {{ he(Emperor) }} lived; hosts of strangers came to visit it every day, and among them one day two swindlers. They gave themselves out as weavers, and said that they knew how to weave the most beautiful stuffs imaginable. Not only were the colours and patterns unusually fine, but the clothes that were made of the stuffs had the peculiar quality of becoming invisible to every person who was not fit for the office {{ he(Emperor) }} held, or if {{ he(Emperor) }} was impossibly dull
'Those must be splendid clothes,' thought the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}. 'By wearing them I should be able to discover which people in my kingdom are unfitted for their posts. I shall distinguish the wise from the fools. Yes, I certainly must order some of that stuff to be woven for me.'
{{ He(Emperor) }} paid the two swindlers a lot of money in advance so that they might begin their work at once.
They did put up two looms and pretended to weave, but they had nothing whatever upon their shuttles. At the outset they asked for a quantity of the finest silk and the purest gold thread, all of which they put into their own bags, while they worked away at the empty looms far into the night.
'I should like to know how those weavers are getting on with the stuff,' thought the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}; but {{ he(Emperor) }} felt a little queer when {{ he(Emperor) }} reflected that any one who was stupid or unfit for {{ hisd(Emperor) }} post would not be able to see it. {{ He(Emperor) }} certainly thought that {{ he(Emperor) }} need have no fears for {{ himself(Emperor) }}, but still {{ he(Emperor) }} thought {{ he(Emperor) }} would send somebody else first to see how it was getting on. Everybody in the town knew what wonderful power the stuff possessed, and every one was anxious to see how stupid {{ hisd(Emperor) }} neighbour was.
'I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers,' thought the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}. '{{ He(Minister) }} will be best able to see how the stuff looks, for {{ he(Minister) }} is a clever {{ man(Minister) }}, and no one fulfils one’s duties better than {{ he(Minister) }} does!'
So the good old minister went into the room where the two swindlers sat working at the empty loom.
'Heaven preserve us!' thought the old minister, opening {{ hisd(Minister) }} eyes very wide. 'Why, I can't see a thing!' But {{ he(Minister) }} took care not to say so.
Both the swindlers begged {{ him(Minister) }} to be good enough to step a little nearer, and asked if {{ he(Minister) }} did not think it a good pattern and beautiful colouring. They pointed to the empty loom, and the poor old minister stared as hard as {{ he(Minister) }} could, but {{ he(Minister) }} could not see anything, for of course there was nothing to see.
'Good heavens!' thought {{ he(Minister) }}, 'is it possible that I am a fool. I have never thought so, and nobody must know it. Am I not fit for my post? It will never do to say that I cannot see the stuffs.'
'Well, {{ sir-m(Minister) }}, you don't say anything about the stuff,' said the one who was pretending to weave.
'Oh, it is beautiful! quite charming!' said the old minister, looking through {{ hisd(Minister) }} spectacles; 'this pattern and these colours! I will certainly tell the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} that the stuff pleases me very much.'
'We are delighted to hear you say so,' said the swindlers, and then they named all the colours and described the peculiar pattern. The old minister paid great attention to what they said, so as to be able to repeat it when {{ he(Minister) }} got home to the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}.
They pointed to the empty loom, and the poor old minister stared as hard as {{ he(Minister) }} could, but {{ he(Minister) }} could not see anything, for of course there was nothing to see.
Then the swindlers went on to demand more money, more silk, and more gold, to be able to proceed with the weaving; but they put it all into their own pockets—not a single strand was ever put into the loom, but they went on as before weaving at the empty loom.
The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} soon sent another faithful official to see how the stuff was getting on, and if it would soon be ready. The same thing happened to {{ him(Emperor) }} as to the minister; {{ he(Emperor) }} looked and looked, but as there was only the empty loom, {{ he(Emperor) }} could see nothing at all.
'Is not this a beautiful piece of stuff?' said both the swindlers, showing and explaining the beautiful pattern and colours which were not there to be seen.
'I know I am not a fool!' thought the {{ man(Emperor) }}, 'so it must be that I am unfit for my good post! It is very strange, though! However, one must not let it appear!' So {{ he(Emperor) }} praised the stuff {{ he(Emperor) }} did not see, and assured them of {{ hisd(Emperor) }} delight in the beautiful colours and the originality of the design. 'It is absolutely charming!' {{ he(Emperor) }} said to the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}. Everybody in the town was talking about this splendid stuff.
Now the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} thought {{ he(Emperor) }} would like to see it while it was still on the loom. So, accompanied by a number of selected courtiers, among whom were the two faithful officials who had already seen the imaginary stuff, {{ he(Emperor) }} went to visit the crafty impostors, who were working away as hard as ever they could at the empty loom.
'It is magnificent!' said both the honest officials. 'Only see, your Majesty, what a design! What colours!' And they pointed to the empty loom, for they thought no doubt the others could see the stuff.
'What!' thought the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}; 'I see nothing at all! This is terrible! Am I a fool? Am I not fit to be {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}? Why, nothing worse could happen to me!'
'Oh, it is beautiful!' said the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}. 'It has my highest approval!' and {{ he(Emperor) }} nodded {{ hisd(Emperor) }} satisfaction as {{ he(Emperor) }} gazed at the empty loom. Nothing would induce {{ him(Emperor) }} to say that {{ he(Emperor) }} could not see anything.
The whole suite gazed and gazed, but saw nothing more than all the others. However, they all exclaimed with {{ hisd(Emperor) }} Majesty, 'It is very beautiful!' and they advised {{ him(Emperor) }} to wear a {{ suit(Emperor) }} made of this wonderful cloth on the occasion of a great procession which was just about to take place. 'It is magnificent! gorgeous! excellent!' went from mouth to mouth; they were all equally delighted with it. The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} gave each of the rogues an order of knighthood to be worn in their buttonholes and the title of 'Gentlemen weavers.'
Then the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} walked along in the procession under the gorgeous canopy, and everybody in the streets and at the windows exclaimed, 'How beautiful the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}'s new clothes are!'
The swindlers sat up the whole night, before the day on which the procession was to take place, burning sixteen candles; so that people might see how anxious they were to get the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}'s new clothes ready. They pretended to take the stuff off the loom. They cut it out in the air with a huge pair of scissors, and they stitched away with needles without any thread in them. At last they said: 'Now the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}'s new clothes are ready!'
The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}, with {{ hisd(Emperor) }} grandest courtiers, went to them {{ himself(Emperor) }}, and both the swindlers raised one arm in the air, as if they were holding something, and said: 'See, these are the {{ trousers(Emperor) }}, this is the coat, here is the mantle!' and so on. 'It is as light as a spider's web. One might think one had nothing on, but that is the very beauty of it!'
'Yes!' said all the courtiers, but they could not see anything, for there was nothing to see.
'Will your imperial majesty be graciously pleased to take off your clothes,' said, the impostors, 'so that we may put on the new ones, along here before the great mirror?'
The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} took off all {{ hisd(Emperor) }} clothes, and the impostors pretended to give {{ him(Emperor) }} one article of dress after the other of the new ones which they had pretended to make. They pretended to fasten something round {{ hisd(Emperor) }} waist and to tie on something; this was the train, and the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} turned round and round in front of the mirror.
'How well {{ hisd(Emperor) }} majesty looks in the new clothes! How becoming they are!' cried all the people round. 'What a design, and what colours! They are most gorgeous robes!'
'The canopy is waiting outside which is to be carried over your majesty in the procession,' said the master of the ceremonies.
'Well, I am quite ready,' said the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}. 'Don't the clothes fit well?' and then {{ he(Emperor) }} turned round again in front of the mirror, so that {{ he(Emperor) }} should seem to be looking at {{ hisd(Emperor) }} grand things.
The chamberlains who were to carry the train stooped and pretended to lift it from the ground with both hands, and they walked along with their hands in the air. They dared not let it appear that they could not see anything.
Then the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} walked along in the procession under the gorgeous canopy, and everybody in the streets and at the windows exclaimed, 'How beautiful the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}'s new clothes are! What a splendid train! And they fit to perfection!' Nobody would let it appear that they could see nothing, for then they would not be fit for their post, or else was a fool.
None of the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}'s clothes had been so successful before.
'But {{ he(Emperor) }} has got nothing on,' said a little {{child}}.
'Oh, listen to the innocent,' said its {{father}}; and one person whispered to the other what the {{child}} had said. '{{ He(Emperor) }} has nothing on; a child says {{ he(Emperor) }} has nothing on!'
'But {{ he(Emperor) }} has nothing on!' at last cried all the people.
The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} writhed, for {{ he(Emperor) }} knew it was true, but {{ he(Emperor) }} thought 'the procession must go on now,' so held {{ himself(Emperor) }} stiffer than ever, and the chamberlains held up the invisible train.
