<h1>The Kiss</h1>
<h4>Originally published in 1895. Text from Project Gutenberg</h4>
It was still quite light out of doors, but inside with the curtains drawn and the smouldering fire sending out a dim, uncertain glow, the room was full of deep shadows.
{{ Mrs.(Brantain) }} Brantain sat in one of these shadows; it had overtaken {{ him(Brantain) }} and {{ he(Brantain) }} did not mind. The obscurity lent {{ him(Brantain) }} courage to keep {{ hisd(Brantain) }} eyes fastened as ardently as {{ he(Brantain) }} liked upon the {{ girl(Nathalie) }} who sat in the firelight.
{{ She(Nathalie) }} was very handsome, with a certain fine, rich coloring that belongs to the healthy brune type. {{ She(Nathalie) }} was quite composed, as {{ she(Nathalie) }} idly stroked the satiny coat of the cat that lay curled in {{ herd(Nathalie) }} lap, and {{ she(Nathalie) }} occasionally sent a slow glance into the shadow where {{ herd(Nathalie) }} companion sat. They were talking low, of indifferent things which plainly were not the things that occupied their thoughts. {{ She(Nathalie) }} knew that {{ he(Brantain) }} loved {{ her(Nathalie) }}— {{ he(Brantain) }} was a frank, blustering {{ fellow(Brantain) }} without guile enough to conceal {{ hisd(Brantain) }} feelings, and no desire to do so. For two weeks past {{ he(Brantain) }} had sought {{ herd(Nathalie) }} society eagerly and persistently. {{ She(Nathalie) }} was confidently waiting for {{ him(Brantain) }} to declare {{ himself(Brantain) }} and {{ she(Nathalie) }} meant to accept {{ him(Brantain) }}. The rather insignificant and unattractive {{ widow(Brantain) }} was enormously rich; and the {{ girl(Nathalie) }} liked and required the entourage which wealth could give {{ her(Nathalie) }}.
During one of the pauses between their talk of the last tea and the next reception the door opened and a young {{ man(Harvy) }} entered whom {{ Mrs.(Brantain) }} Brantain knew quite well. The handsome {{ girl(Nathalie) }} turned {{ herd(Nathalie) }} face toward {{ him(Harvy) }}. A stride or two brought {{ him(Harvy) }} to {{ hisd(Nathalie) }} side, and bending over {{ hisd(Nathalie) }} chair—before {{ she(Nathalie) }} could suspect {{ hisd(Harvy) }} intention, for {{ she(Nathalie) }} did not realize that {{ he(Harvy) }} had not seen {{ hisd(Nathalie) }} visitor—{{ he(Harvy) }} pressed an ardent, lingering kiss upon {{ hisd(Nathalie) }} lips.
{{ Mrs.(Brantain) }} Brantain slowly arose; so did the {{ girl(Nathalie) }} arise, but quickly, and the newcomer stood between them, a little amusement and some defiance struggling with the confusion in {{ hisd(Harvy) }} face.
“I believe,” stammered the {{ widow(Brantain) }}, “I see that I have stayed too long. I—I had no idea—that is, I must wish you good-by.” {{ He(Brantain) }} was clutching {{ hisd(Brantain) }} hat with both hands, and probably did not perceive that {{ she(Nathalie) }} was extending {{ herd(Nathalie) }} hand to {{ him(Brantain) }}, {{ herd(Nathalie) }} presence of mind had not completely deserted {{ her(Nathalie) }}; but {{ she(Nathalie) }} could not have trusted {{ herself(Nathalie) }} to speak.
“Hang me if I saw {{ him(Brantain) }} sitting there, Nattie! I know it’s deuced awkward for you. But I hope you’ll forgive me this once—this very first break. Why, what’s the matter?”
“Don’t touch me; don’t come near me,” {{ she(Nathalie) }} returned angrily. “What do you mean by entering the house without ringing?”
“I came in with your {{ brother(Harvy) }}, as I often do,” {{ he(Harvy) }} answered coldly, in self-justification. “We came in the side way. {{ He(Harvy) }} went upstairs and I came in here hoping to find you. The explanation is simple enough and ought to satisfy you that the misadventure was unavoidable. But do say that you forgive me, {{Nathalie}},” {{ he(Harvy) }} entreated, softening.
“Forgive you! You don’t know what you are talking about. Let me pass. It depends upon—a good deal whether I ever forgive you.”
At that next reception which {{ she(Nathalie) }} and {{ Mrs.(Brantain) }} Brantain had been talking about {{ she(Nathalie) }} approached the {{ gentleman(Brantain) }} with a delicious frankness of manner when {{ she(Nathalie) }} saw {{ him(Brantain ) }} there.
“Will you let me speak to you a moment or two, {{ sir(Brantain) }}?” {{ she(Nathalie) }} asked with an engaging but perturbed smile. {{ He(Brantain) }} seemed extremely unhappy; but when {{ she(Nathalie) }} took {{ hisd(Brantain) }} arm and walked away with {{ him(Brantain) }}, seeking a retired corner, a ray of hope mingled with the almost comical misery of {{ hisd(Brantain) }} expression. {{ She(Nathalie) }} was apparently very outspoken.
“Perhaps I should not have sought this interview; but—but, oh, I have been very uncomfortable, almost miserable since that little encounter the other afternoon. When I thought how you might have misinterpreted it, and believed things”—hope was plainly gaining the ascendancy over misery in {{ Mrs.(Brantain) }} Brantain’s round, guileless face—“Of course, I know it is nothing to you, but for my own sake I do want you to understand that {{ Mr.(Harvy ) }} Harvy is an intimate friend of long standing. Why, we have always been like cousins—like {{ brother(Harvy) }} and {{ sister(Nathalie) }}, I may say. {{ He(Harvy) }} is my {{ brother(Harvy) }}’s most intimate associate and often fancies that {{ he(Harvy) }} is entitled to the same privileges as the family. Oh, I know it is absurd, uncalled for, to tell you this; undignified even,” {{ she(Nathalie) }} was almost weeping, “but it makes so much difference to me what you think of—of me.” {{ Herd(Nathalie) }} voice had grown very low and agitated. The misery had all disappeared from the {{ gentleman(Brantain) }}’s face.
“Then you do really care what I think, {{Nathalie}}? May I call you {{Nathalie}}?” They turned into a long, dim corridor that was lined on either side with tall, graceful plants. They walked slowly to the very end of it. When they turned to retrace their steps {{ Mrs.(Brantain) }} Brantain’s face was radiant and {{ hers(Nathalie) }} was triumphant.
{{ Mr.(Harvy) }} Harvy was among the guests at the wedding; and {{ he(Harvy ) }} sought {{Nathalie}} out in a rare moment when {{ she(Nathalie) }} stood alone.
“Your {{ husband(Brantain) }},” {{ he(Harvy) }} said, smiling, “has sent me over to kiss you.”
A quick blush suffused {{ herd(Nathalie) }} face and round polished throat. “I suppose it’s natural for a {{ man(Brantain) }} to feel and act generously on an occasion of this kind. {{ He(Brantain) }} tells me {{ he(Brantain) }} doesn’t want marriage to interrupt wholly that pleasant intimacy which has existed between you and me. I don’t know what you’ve been telling {{ him(Brantain) }},” with an insolent smile, “but {{ he(Brantain) }} has sent me here to kiss you.”
{{ She(Nathalie) }} felt like a chess player who, by the clever handling of {{ hisd(Nathalie) }} pieces, sees the game taking the course intended. {{ Herd(Nathalie) }} eyes were bright and tender with a smile as they glanced up into {{ his(Harvy) }}; and {{ herd(Nathalie) }} lips looked hungry for the kiss which they invited.
“But, you know,” {{ he(Harvy) }} went on quietly, “I didn’t tell {{ him(Brantain) }} so, it would have seemed ungrateful, but I can tell you. I’ve stopped kissing {{ women(Nathalie) }}; it’s dangerous.”
Well, {{ she(Nathalie) }} had {{ hisd(Nathalie) }} {{ husband(Brantain) }} and {{ hisd(Brantain) }} million left. A person can’t have everything in this world; and it was a little unreasonable of {{ her(Nathalie) }} to expect it.
