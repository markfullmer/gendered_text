<h4>Original Text from AmericanLiterature.com</h4>
In 1830, only a few miles away from what is now the great city of Cincinnati, lay an immense and almost unbroken forest. The whole region was sparsely settled by people of the frontier--restless souls who no sooner had hewn fairly habitable homes out of the wilderness and attained to that degree of prosperity which today we should call indigence, than, impelled by some mysterious impulse of their nature, they abandoned all and pushed farther westward, to encounter new perils and privations in the effort to regain the meager comforts which they had voluntarily renounced. Many of them had already forsaken that region for the remoter settlements, but among those remaining was one who had been of those first arriving. {{ He(Murlock) }} lived alone in a house of logs surrounded on all sides by the great forest, of whose gloom and silence {{ he(Murlock) }} seemed a part, for no one had ever known {{ him(Murlock) }} to smile nor speak a needless word. {{ Hisd(Murlock) }} simple wants were supplied by the sale or barter of skins of wild animals in the river town, for not a thing did {{ he(Murlock) }} grow upon the land which, if needful, {{ he(Murlock) }} might have claimed by right of undisturbed possession. There were evidences of "improvement"--a few acres of ground immediately about the house had once been cleared of its trees, the decayed stumps of which were half concealed by the new growth that had been suffered to repair the ravage wrought by the ax. Apparently the {{ man(Murlock) }}'s zeal for agriculture had burned with a failing flame, expiring in penitential ashes.
The little log house, with its chimney of sticks, its roof of warping clapboards weighted with traversing poles and its "chinking" of clay, had a single door and, directly opposite, a window. The latter, however, was boarded up--nobody could remember a time when it was not. And none knew why it was so closed; certainly not because of the occupant's dislike of light and air, for on those rare occasions when a hunter had passed that lonely spot the recluse had commonly been seen sunning {{ himself(Murlock) }} on {{ hisd(Murlock) }} doorstep if heaven had provided sunshine for {{ hisd(Murlock) }} need. I fancy there are few persons living today who ever knew the secret of that window, but I am one, as you shall see.
The {{ man(Murlock) }}'s name was said to be {{Murlock}}. {{ He(Murlock) }} was apparently seventy years old, actually about fifty. Something besides years had had a hand in {{ hisd(Murlock) }} aging. {{ Hisd(Murlock) }} long, full {{ beard(Murlock) }} was white, {{ hisd(Murlock) }} gray, lusterless eyes sunken, {{ hisd(Murlock) }} face singularly seamed with wrinkles which appeared to belong to two intersecting systems. In figure {{ he(Murlock) }} was tall and spare, with a stoop of the shoulders--a burden bearer. I never saw {{ him(Murlock) }}; these particulars I learned from my grand{{ father(grandfather) }}, from whom also I got the {{ man(Murlock) }}'s story when I was a {{ lad(narrator) }}. {{ He(grandfather) }} had known {{ him(Murlock) }} when living near by in that early day.
One day {{Murlock}} was found in {{ hisd(Murlock) }} cabin, dead. It was not a time and place for coroners and newspapers, and I suppose it was agreed that {{ he(Murlock) }} had died from natural causes or I should have been told, and should remember. I know only that with what was probably a sense of the fitness of things the body was buried near the cabin, alongside the grave of {{ hisd(Murlock) }} {{ wife(wife) }}, who had preceded {{ him(Murlock) }} by so many years that local tradition had retained hardly a hint of {{ herd(wife) }} existence. That closes the final chapter of this true story--excepting, indeed, the circumstance that many years afterward, in company with an equally intrepid spirit, I penetrated to the place and ventured near enough to the ruined cabin to throw a stone against it, and ran away to avoid the ghost which every well-informed boy and girl thereabout knew haunted the spot. But there is an earlier chapter--that supplied by my grand{{ father(grandfather)}}.
When {{Murlock}} built {{ hisd(Murlock) }} cabin and began laying sturdily about with {{ hisd(Murlock) }} ax to hew out a farm--the rifle, meanwhile, {{ hisd(Murlock) }} means of support--{{ he(Murlock) }} was young, strong and full of hope. In that eastern country whence {{ he(Murlock) }} came {{ he(Murlock) }} had married, as was the fashion, a young {{ woman(wife) }} in all ways worthy of {{ hisd(Murlock) }} honest devotion, who shared the dangers and privations of {{ hisd(Murlock) }} lot with a willing spirit and light heart. There is no known record of {{ herd(wife) }} name; of {{ herd(wife) }} charms of mind and person tradition is silent and the doubter is at liberty to entertain {{ hisd(Murlock) }} doubt; but God forbid that I should share it! Of their affection and happiness there is abundant assurance in every added day of the {{ man(Murlock) }}'s widowed life; for what but the magnetism of a blessed memory could have chained that venturesome spirit to a lot like that?
One day {{Murlock}} returned from gunning in a distant part of the forest to find {{ hisd(Murlock) }} {{ wife(wife) }} prostrate with fever, and delirious. There was no physician within miles, no neighbor; nor was {{ she(wife) }} in a condition to be left, to summon help. So {{ he(Murlock) }} set about the task of nursing {{ her(wife) }} back to health, but at the end of the third day {{ she(wife) }} fell into unconsciousness arid so passed away, apparently, with never a gleam of returning reason.
From what we know of a nature like {{ his(Murlock) }} we may venture to sketch in some of the details of the outline picture drawn by my grand{{ father(grandfather)}}. When convinced that {{ she(wife) }} was dead, {{Murlock}} had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty {{ he(Murlock) }} blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which {{ he(Murlock) }} did correctly were done over and over. {{ Hisd(Murlock) }} occasional failures to accomplish some simple and ordinary act filled {{ him(Murlock) }} with astonishment, like that of a drunken {{ man(Murlock) }} who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. {{ He(Murlock) }} was surprised, too, that {{ he(Murlock) }} did not weep--surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. "Tomorrow," {{ he(Murlock) }} said aloud, "I shall have to make the coffin arid dig the grave; and then I shall miss {{ her(wife) }}, when {{ she(wife) }} is no longer in sight; but now--{{ she(wife) }} is dead, of course, but it is all right--it must be all right, somehow. Things cannot be so bad as they seem."
{{ He(Murlock) }} stood over the body in the fading light, adjusting the hair and putting the finishing touches to the simple toilet, doing all mechanically, with soulless care. And still through {{ hisd(Murlock) }} consciousness ran an undersense of conviction that all was right--that {{ he(Murlock) }} should have {{ her(wife) }} again as before, and everything explained. {{ He(Murlock) }} had had no experience in grief; {{ hisd(Murlock) }} capacity had not been enlarged by use. {{ Hisd(Murlock) }} heart could not contain it all, nor {{ hisd(Murlock) }} imagination rightly conceive it. {{ He(Murlock) }} did not know {{ he(Murlock) }} was so hard struck; that knowledge would come later, and never go. Grief is an artist of powers as various as the instruments upon which {{ he(Murlock) }} plays {{ hisd(Murlock) }} dirges for the dead, evoking from some the sharpest, shrillest notes, from others the low, grave chords that throb recurrent like the slow beating of a distant drum. Some natures it startles; some it stupefies. To one it comes like the stroke of an arrow, stinging all the sensibilities to a keener life; to another as the blow of a bludgeon, which in crushing benumbs. We may conceive {{Murlock}} to have been that way affected, for (and here we are upon surer ground than that of conjecture) no sooner had {{ he(Murlock) }} finished {{ his(Murlockd) }} pious work than, sinking into a chair by the side of the table upon which the body lay, and noting how white the profile showed in the deepening gloom, {{ he(Murlock) }} laid {{ hisd(Murlock) }} arms upon the table's edge, and dropped {{ hisd(Murlock) }} face into them, tearless yet and unutterably weary. At that moment came in through the open window a long, wailing sound like the cry of a lost child in the far deeps of the darkening woods! But the {{ man(Murlock) }} did not move. Again, and nearer than before, sounded that unearthly cry upon {{ hisd(Murlock) }} failing sense. Perhaps it was a wild beast; perhaps it was a dream. For {{Murlock}} was asleep.
Some hours later, as it afterward appeared, this unfaithful watcher awoke and lifting {{ hisd(Murlock) }} head from {{ hisd(Murlock) }} arms intently listened--{{ he(Murlock) }} knew not why. There in the black darkness by the side of the dead, recalling all without a shock, {{ he(Murlock) }} strained {{ hisd(Murlock) }} eyes to see--{{ he( Murlock) }} knew not what. {{ Hisd(Murlock) }} senses were all alert, {{ hisd(Murlock) }} breath was suspended, {{ hisd(Murlock) }} blood had stilled its tides as if to assist the silence. Who--what had waked {{ him(Murlock) }}, and where was it?
Suddenly the table shook beneath {{ hisd(Murlock) }} arms, and at the same moment {{ he(Murlock) }} heard, or fancied that {{ he(Murlock) }} heard, a light, soft step--another--sounds as of bare feet upon the floor!
{{ He(Murlock) }} was terrified beyond the power to cry out or move. Perforce {{ he(Murlock) }} waited--waited there in the darkness through seeming centuries of such dread as one may know, yet live to tell. {{ He(Murlock) }} tried vainly to speak the dead {{ woman(wife) }}'s name, vainly to stretch forth {{ hisd(Murlock) }} hand across the table to learn if {{ she(wife) }} were there. {{ Hisd(Murlock) }} throat was powerless, {{ hisd(Murlock) }} arms and hands were like lead. Then occurred something most frightful. Some heavy body seemed hurled against the table with an impetus that pushed it against {{ hisd(Murlock) }} breast so sharply as nearly to overthrow {{ him(Murlock) }}, and at the same instant {{ he(Murlock) }} heard and felt the fall of something upon the floor with so violent a thump that the whole house was shaken by the impact. A scuffling ensued, and a confusion of sounds impossible to describe. {{Murlock}} had risen to {{ hisd(Murlock) }} feet. Fear had by excess forfeited control of {{ hisd(Murlock) }} faculties. {{ He(Murlock) }} flung {{ hisd(Murlock) }} hands upon the table. Nothing was there!
There is a point at which terror may turn to madness; and madness incites to action. With no definite intent, from no motive but the wayward impulse of a madman, {{Murlock}} sprang to the wall, with a little groping seized {{ hisd(Murlock) }} loaded rifle, and without aim discharged it. By the flash which lit up the room with a vivid illumination, {{ he(Murlock) }} saw an enormous panther dragging the dead {{ woman(wife) }} toward the window, its teeth fixed in {{ herd(wife) }} throat! Then there were darkness blacker than before, and silence; and when {{ he(Murlock) }} returned to consciousness the sun was high and the wood vocal with songs of birds.
The body lay near the window, where the beast had left it when frightened away by the flash and report of the rifle. The clothing was deranged, the long hair in disorder, the limbs lay anyhow. From the throat, dreadfully lacerated, had issued a pool of blood not yet entirely coagulated. The ribbon with which {{ he(Murlock) }} had bound the wrists was broken; the hands were tightly clenched. Between the teeth was a fragment of the animal's ear.
