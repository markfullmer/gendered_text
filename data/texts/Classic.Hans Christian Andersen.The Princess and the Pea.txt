<h1>The {{ Princess(Princess1) }} and the Pea</h1>
Once upon a time there was a {{ prince(Prince2) }} who wanted to marry a {{ princess(Princess1) }}; but {{ she(Princess1) }} would have to be a real {{ princess(Princess1) }}. {{ He(Prince2) }} travelled all over the world to find one, but nowhere could {{ he(Prince2) }} get what {{ he(Prince2) }} wanted. There were contenders enough, but it was difficult to find out whether they were real royalty. There was always something about them that was not as it should be. So {{ he(Prince2) }} came home again and was sad, for {{ he(Prince2) }} would have liked very much to have a real {{ princess(Princess1) }}.
One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old {{ king(King1) }} went to open it.
It was a {{ princess(Princess1) }} standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made {{ her(Princess1) }} look. The water ran down from {{ herd(Princess1) }} hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of {{ herd(Princess1) }} shoes and out again at the heels. And yet {{ she(Princess1) }} said that {{ she(Princess1) }} was a real {{ princess(Princess1) }}.
“Well, we’ll soon find that out,” thought the old {{ queen(Queen2) }}. But {{ she(Queen2) }} said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then {{ she(Queen2) }} took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.
On this the {{ princess(Princess1) }} had to lie all night. In the morning {{ she(Princess1) }} was asked how {{ she(Princess1) }} had slept.
“Oh, very badly!” said {{ she(Princess1) }}. “I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It’s horrible!”
Now they knew that {{ she(Princess1) }} was a real {{ princess(Princess1) }} because {{ she(Princess1) }} had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.
Nobody but a real {{ princess(Princess1) }} could be as sensitive as that.
So the {{ prince(Prince2) }} took {{ her(Princess1) }} for {{ hisd(Prince2) }} {{ wife(Princess1) }}, for now {{ he(Prince2) }} knew that {{ he(Prince2) }} had a real {{ princess(Princess1) }}; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, if no one has stolen it.
There, that is a true story.
