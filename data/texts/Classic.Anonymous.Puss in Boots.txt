<h1>Puss in Boots</h1>
[[Puss/Puss/Puss:male] [Marchioness/Marquis/Marques:male] [milliner/miller/milliner:male] [rabbit/rabbit/rabbit:male][Queen/King/Sovereign:male] [princess/prince/royal-heir:female] [Ogress/Ogre/Ogre:male]]
Once upon a time there was a {{miller}} who left no more riches to the three {{ sons(Marquis) }} {{ he(miller) }} had than {{ hisd(miller) }} property, {{ hisd(miller) }} ass, and {{ hisd(miller) }} cat. The division was soon made. Neither the lawyer nor the attorney was sent for. They would soon have eaten up all the poor property. The eldest had the property, the second the ass, and the youngest nothing but the cat.
The youngest, as we can understand, was quite unhappy at having so poor a share.
"My {{ brothers(Marquis) }}," said {{ he(Marquis) }}, "may get their living handsomely enough by joining their stocks together; but, for my part, when I have eaten up my cat, and made me a muff of {{ hisd(Puss) }} skin, I must die of hunger."
The Cat, who heard all this, without appearing to take any notice, said to {{ him(Marquis) }} with a grave and serious air:—
"Do not thus afflict yourself, my {{ master(Marquis) }}; you have nothing else to do but to give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for me, that I may scamper through the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so poor a portion in me as you think."
Though the Cat's {{ master(Marquis) }} did not think much of what {{ he(Puss) }} said, {{ he(Marquis) }} had seen {{ him(Puss) }} play such cunning tricks to catch rats and mice—hanging {{ himself(Puss) }} by the heels, or hiding {{ himself(Puss) }} in the meal, to make believe {{ he(Puss) }} was dead—that {{ he(Marquis) }} did not altogether despair of {{ hisd(Puss) }} helping {{ him(Marquis) }} in {{ hisd(Marquis) }} misery. When the Cat had what {{ he(Puss) }} asked for, {{ he(Puss) }} booted {{ himself(Puss) }} very gallantly, and putting {{ hisd(Puss) }} bag about {{ hisd(Puss) }} neck, {{ he(Puss) }} held the strings of it in {{ hisd(Puss) }} two forepaws, and went into a warren where was a great number of rabbits. {{ He(Puss) }} put bran and sow-thistle into {{ hisd(Puss) }} bag, and, stretching out at length, as if {{ he(Puss) }} were dead, {{ he(Puss) }} waited for some young rabbits, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage {{ hisd(Puss) }} bag for what {{ he(Puss) }} had put into it.
Scarcely was {{ he(Puss) }} settled but {{ he(Puss) }} had what {{ he(Puss) }} wanted. A rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into {{ hisd(Puss) }} bag, and {{ Monsieur(Puss) }} Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took {{ him(rabbit) }} and killed {{ him(rabbit) }} at once. Proud of {{ hisd(Puss) }} prey, {{ he(Puss) }} went with it to the palace, and asked to speak with the {{ King(King) }}. {{ He(Puss) }} was shown upstairs into {{ hisd(King) }} Majesty's apartment, and, making a low bow to the {{ King(King) }}, {{ he(Puss) }} said:—
"I have brought you, {{ sire(King) }}, a rabbit which my noble {{ Lord(Marquis) }}, the {{ Master(Marquis) }} of Carabas" (for that was the title which Puss was pleased to give {{ hisd(Marquis) }} {{ master(Marquis) }}) "has commanded me to present to your Majesty from {{ him(Marquis) }}."
"Tell thy {{ master(Marquis) }}," said the {{ King(King) }}, "that I thank {{ him(Marquis) }}, and that I am pleased with {{ hisd(Marquis) }} gift."
Another time {{ he(Puss) }} went and hid {{ himself(Puss) }} among some standing corn, still holding {{ hisd(Puss) }} bag open; and when a brace of partridges ran into it, {{ he(Puss) }} drew the strings, and so caught them both. {{ He(Puss) }} then went and made a present of these to the {{ King(King) }}, as {{ he(Puss) }} had done before of the rabbit which {{ he(Puss) }} took in the warren. The {{ King(King) }}, in like manner, received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered {{ hisd(King) }} servants to reward {{ him(Puss) }}.
The Cat continued for two or three months thus to carry {{ hisd(King) }} Majesty, from time to time, some of {{ hisd(Puss) }} {{ master(Marquis) }}'s game. One day when {{ he(Puss) }} knew that the {{ King(King) }} was to take the air along the riverside, with {{ hisd(King) }} {{ daughter(princess) }}, the most beautiful {{ princess(princess) }} in the world, {{ he(Puss) }} said to {{ hisd(Puss) }} {{ master(Marquis) }}:—
"If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made. You have nothing else to do but go and bathe in the river, just at the spot I shall show you, and leave the rest to me."
The {{Marquis}} of Carabas did what the Cat advised {{ him(Marquis) }} to, without knowing what could be the use of doing it. While {{ he(Marquis) }} was bathing, the {{ King(King) }} passed by, and the Cat cried out with all {{ hisd(Puss) }} might:—
"Help! help! My {{ Lord(Marquis) }} the {{Marquis}} of Carabas is drowning!"
At this noise the {{ King(King) }} put {{ hisd(King) }} head out of the coach window, and seeing the Cat who had so often brought {{ him(King) }} game, {{ he(King) }} commanded {{ hisd(King) }} guards to run immediately to the assistance of {{ hisd(Marquis) }} {{ Lord(Marquis) }}ship the {{Marquis}} of Carabas.
While they were drawing the poor {{Marquis}} out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach and told the {{ King(King) }} that, while {{ hisd(Puss) }} {{ master(Marquis) }} was bathing, there came by some rogues, who ran off with {{ hisd(Marquis) }} clothes, though {{ he(Marquis) }} had cried out, "Thieves! thieves!" several times, as loud as {{ he(Marquis) }} could. The cunning Cat had hidden the clothes under a great stone. The {{ King(King) }} immediately commanded the officers of {{ hisd(King) }} wardrobe to run and fetch one of {{ hisd(King) }} best suits for the {{ Lord(Marquis) }} {{Marquis}} of Carabas.

"The {{Marquis}} of Carabas is drowning!" "The {{Marquis}} of Carabas is drowning!"
The {{ King(King) }} was extremely polite to {{ him(Marquis) }}, and as the fine clothes {{ he(King) }} had given {{ him(Marquis) }} set off {{ hisd(Marquis) }} good looks (for {{ he(Marquis) }} was well made and handsome), the {{ King(King) }}'s {{ daughter(princess) }} found {{ him(Marquis) }} very much to {{ herd(princess) }} liking, and the {{Marquis}} of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances than {{ she(princess) }} fell in love with {{ him(Marquis) }} to distraction. The {{ King(King) }} would have {{ him(Marquis) }} come into the coach and take part in the airing. The Cat, overjoyed to see {{ hisd(Puss) }} plan begin to succeed, marched on before, and, meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, {{ he(Puss) }} said to them:—
"Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the {{ King(King) }} that the meadow you mow belongs to my {{ Lord(Marquis) }} {{Marquis}} of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot."
The {{ King(King) }} did not fail to ask the mowers to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged.
"To my {{ Lord(Marquis) }} {{Marquis}} of Carabas," answered they all together, for the Cat's threat had made them afraid.
"You have a good property there," said the {{ King(King) }} to the {{Marquis}} of Carabas.
"You see, {{ sire(King) }}," said the {{Marquis}}, "this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year."
The Puss in Boots, who went still on before, met with some reapers, and said to them:—
"Good people, you who are reaping, if you do not say that all this corn belongs to the {{Marquis}} of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot."
The {{ King(King) }}, who passed by a moment after, wished to know to whom belonged all that corn, which {{ he(King) }} then saw.
"To my {{ Lord(Marquis) }} {{Marquis}} of Carabas," replied the reapers, and the {{ King(King) }} was very well pleased with it, as well as the {{Marquis}}, whom {{ he(King) }} congratulated thereupon. The Puss in Boots, who went always before, said the same thing to all {{ he(Puss) }} met, and the {{ King(King) }} was astonished at the vast estates of my {{ Lord(Marquis) }} {{Marquis}} of Carabas.
{{ Monsieur(Puss) }} Puss came at last to a stately castle, the {{ master(Ogre) }} of which was an {{Ogre}}, the richest ever known; for all the lands which the {{ King(King) }} had then passed through belonged to this castle. The Cat, who had taken care to inform {{ himself(Puss) }} who this {{Ogre}} was and what {{ he(Ogre) }} could do, asked to speak with {{ him(Ogre) }}, saying {{ he(Puss) }} could not pass so near {{ hisd(Ogre) }} castle without having the honor of paying {{ hisd(Puss) }} respects to {{ him(Ogre) }}.
The {{Ogre}} received {{ him(Puss) }} as civilly as an {{Ogre}} could do, and made {{ him(Puss) }} sit down.
"I have been assured," said the Cat, "that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to; that you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and the like."
"That is true," answered the Ogre, roughly; "and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion."
Puss was so terrified at the sight of a lion so near {{ him(Puss) }} that {{ he(Puss) }} immediately climbed into the gutter, not without much trouble and danger, because of {{ hisd(Puss) }} boots, which were of no use at all to {{ him(Puss) }} for walking upon the tiles. A little while after, when Puss saw that the {{Ogre}} had resumed {{ hisd(Ogre) }} natural form, {{ he(Ogre) }} came down, and owned {{ he(Ogre) }} had been very much frightened.
"I have, moreover, been informed," said the Cat, "but I know not how to believe it, that; you have also the power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals; for example, to change yourself into a rat or a mouse, but I must own to you I take this to be impossible."
"Impossible!" cried the {{Ogre}}; "you shall see." And at the same time {{ he(Ogre) }} changed {{ himself(Ogre) }} into a mouse, and began to run about the floor. Puss no sooner perceived this than {{ he(Puss) }} fell upon {{ him(Ogre) }} and ate {{ him(Ogre) }} up.
Meanwhile, the {{ King(King) }}, who saw, as {{ he(King) }} passed, this fine castle of the {{Ogre}}'s, had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise of {{ hisd(King) }} Majesty's coach coming over the drawbridge, ran out, and said to the {{ King(King) }}, "Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my {{ Lord(Marquis) }} {{Marquis}} of Carabas."
"What! my {{ Lord(Marquis) }} {{Marquis}}," cried the {{ King(King) }}, "and does this castle also belong to you? There can be nothing finer than this courtyard and all the stately buildings which surround it; let us see the interior, if you please."
The {{Marquis}} gave {{ hisd(Marquis) }} hand to the young {{ Princess(princess) }}, and followed the {{ King(King) }}, who went first. They passed into the great hall, where they found a magnificent collation, which the {{Ogre}} had prepared for {{ hisd(Ogre) }} friends, who were that very day to visit {{ him(Ogre) }}, but dared not to enter, knowing the {{ King(King) }} was there. {{ Hisd(King) }} Majesty, charmed with the good qualities of my {{ Lord(Marquis) }} of Carabas, as was also {{ hisd(King) }} {{ daughter(princess) }}, who had fallen violently in love with {{ him(Marquis) }}, and seeing the vast estate {{ he(Marquis) }} possessed, said to {{ him(Marquis) }}:—
"It will be owing to yourself only, my {{ Lord(Marquis) }} {{Marquis}}, if you are not my {{ son(Marquis) }}-in-law."
The {{Marquis}}, with low bows, accepted the honor which {{ hisd(King) }} Majesty conferred upon {{ him(Marquis) }}, and forthwith that very same day married the {{ Princess(princess) }}.
Puss became a great {{ lord(Puss) }}, and never ran after mice any more except for {{ hisd(Puss) }} diversion.
