At the beginning, at the very very beginning of time, the General ate a bullet. Those of us who weren’t sure about the dukun were worried, and we sat with our elbows on our knees and our chins on our fists around the table, under the single naked bulb with the dangling string. The dukun, who said {{ hisd(Kurang) }} name was {{Kurang}}, had already washed the bullet in holy water that {{ he(Kurang) }} said came from the very north-of-the-equator springs the Sultans of Sriwijaya bathed in. {{ He(Kurang) }} said some incantations and then told the General to eat it.
“There. Eat. Eat it. It will make you know things about people, so you know where to aim when you shoot them.”
The General stared at the bullet until sweat dropped onto the plate.
{{Kurang}} bent over. “{{ Mister(General) }} General,” {{ he(Kurang) }} said, “I promise, good things will happen. You’ll see like a garuda, {{ Mister(General) }} General.” {{ He(Kurang) }} always mocked us. {{Kurang}} was one of those villagers who doesn’t really give a shit about national unity. They’re godless people and that’s another thing that bothered me, because the General was devout as all hell. “And then you lift your gun, or they lift their guns…” {{ he(Kurang) }} looked at us, the uncomfortable posse. “And you know exactly where to aim. This bullet has the gift, {{ Mister(General) }} General. It will give you the gift too.”
We’d pulled it out of a dead {{ man(Communist) }} two days earlier. A clean heart wound that had punctured a major artery – {{ he(Communist) }} died immediately. It was perfect, we thought as we smoked our Marlboros and sat on our folding chairs, watching the corpse. Of course we bound {{ him(Communist) }} up first and put {{ him(Communist) }} against the chalk sketch lines on the basement wall so {{ he(Communist) }} wouldn’t squirm and so we knew where to nuzzle the barrel. What {{Kurang}} told us was this: the dead {{ man(Communist) }} has to be the right {{ man(Communist) }}, the bullet has to go through the heart, and the bullet has to kill right away.
{{ He(Communist) }} was someone who’d been in on our list for a while. A Communist, of course, a party pusher who carried around paperback Mao and mingled with pushcart-peddlers and pretended to be one of them. {{ He(Communist) }} was going to go eventually, so we figured, may as well be now.
“Eat it, {{ Mister(General) }} General. Don’t you want to be a great {{ man(General) }}?”
{{ He(General) }} took it like a pill. {{ He(General) }} started choking. We pushed our chairs back and got up and cursed at {{Kurang}} but {{Kurang}} was already right at the General’s side, helping {{ him(General) }} swallow the tea. “There, there,” said {{Kurang}}. “Hush hush, it’s okay, {{ Mister(General) }} General.”
We waited for something to change. Nothing did at first. The General made a joke, we laughed; {{ he(General) }} announced {{ he(General) }} was going to bed to sleep, and {{Kurang}} said that was a good idea. The General walked out of the room rubbing {{ hisd(General) }} ribcage, looking puzzled. We said to ourselves: okay, if {{ he(General) }}’s dead tomorrow morning, so is that dukun.
But {{ he(General) }} wasn’t dead. {{ He(General) }} was up bright and early and {{ he(General) }} wasn’t wearing {{ hisd(General) }} glasses when we had our morning meeting in {{ hisd(General) }} office. {{ He(General) }} doled us out assignments. They had schedules on them and everything. We asked {{ him(General) }} why {{ he(General) }} wasn’t wearing {{ hisd(General) }} glasses and {{ he(General) }} said, “Don’t need them. I feel so sharp today. It’s like looking through a submarine periscope, you know?” And {{ he(General) }} made this pantomime motion of a navy admiral looking through a periscope and adjusting the lens and then laughed. We all laughed. {{ He(General) }} laughed until {{ he(General) }} coughed out a tiny pellet of a bullet that burned one of {{ hisd(General) }} memos. We asked the dukun but {{ he(Kurang) }} said that was a normal side effect.
So that was how it started. Nothing very strange. My {{ daughter(daughter) }} was drawing people’s faces back then, which was also not very strange, except {{ she(daughter) }} never filled them in. Whole families without faces.
***
A week later the General had indirectly sent ten of the most dangerous Communist strategists into the next world. I assume they went to hell, but I’ve never been to check. They were hidden ones with inconspicuous day jobs – moonlighters. One was a doctor, one taught mathematics. The Communists were squabbling now like hens without a rooster, and they went looking for new warmth. They went for the navy. I don’t know what’s wrong with the navy, if it’s from fighting pirates in the Sunda Strait or if it’s just being seaborne that fucks with your head, but they had too many dinners with Communists. I have always thought this. I was getting out of the lounge when I saw {{Kurang}} on the street corner in this horrible fake trenchcoat with buttons hanging like eyes out of sockets. {{ He(Kurang) }} wasn’t even smoking, {{ he(Kurang) }} was just there.
“What? Looking for a {{ hooker-opp(Kurang) }}?”
“You want to help {{ Mister(General) }} General, right, Lieutenant?”
I looked around for any President’s {{ men(soldiers) }}. Just zombies and shapeshifters, hanging around in rags and eating noodles, probably infected with hookworm eggs. I looked at {{Kurang}}. “Are you following me?”
“You’re the best Lieutenant. {{ Mister(General) }} General needs to get the navy to see {{ hisd(General) }} way, see?”
There were all these prickly red, bulging spots on {{ hisd(Kurang) }} face. Sometimes I thought they were moving, but then I’d think, no, trick of the light.
“There’s this knife, a kris. It’s on one of the outer islands. Right now a {{fisherman}}’s {{ son(son2) }} has it. If the General eats it {{ he(General) }} will be able to draw people to {{ him(General) }} and command them, you know, make them see like {{ he(General) }} sees. You go get it and bring it here, we’ll dress it up nice.”
It was for the General, so, okay. I love this country, and Communism’s a Satan and the President’s its lackey. Leave it to them and we’ll all be starving and dying in shrapnel and colorful bombs. No, no. We need a {{ man(General) }} like the General, an honest {{ man(General) }}. {{ He(General) }}’s one of us.
Before I left I went home. My {{ daughter(daughter) }} had begun to draw deep-sea creatures by then. {{ She(daughter) }} gave them all to me, slips of paper that {{ she(daughter) }} folded into infinite squares and I put in my wallet. “To protect {{ Daddy(Lieutenant) }},” {{ she(daughter) }} said, and then went back in the house. I hated the pictures. Curling, coiling beasts. I didn’t want their protection, but I kept them anyway.
***
I stood on the sand, shifting. The waves there came from Australia. The dukun told me the name of the island and village and the {{ man(son2) }}, and I asked the locals to fill in the rest. When they saw my credentials and I said that the General needed their help, they helped me. Sometimes I had to show them my gun.
I got to the beach by motorbike. That was our last frontier, those eastern islands. They were populated by people but I think those people were a different species. It was in their eyes. I could tell. Even the children had that look. They all had filariasis, and maybe that was why – microscopic worms sleeping in their veins. It’s a horrible disease. They’re the only people in this heat-soaked country who shiver in the sun.
At the beach there was no one. There was a limping half-wild dog, and there was a kite. I thought the {{ men(patrons) }} at the convenience store had lied to me, it wouldn’t be too surprising, but then I saw {{ him(son2) }} – seventeen years old, curly black hair, standing by {{ hisd(son2) }} {{ father(fisherman) }}’s boat. {{ He(son2) }} had the kris sticking out of {{ hisd(son2) }} backpocket. {{ He(son2) }} didn’t know what to do with either. I went toward {{ him(son2) }} and stood on the shifting sand and called to {{ him(son2) }} to give me the knife, I worked for the General and I needed it.
{{ Hisd(son2) }} lips moved and {{ hisd(son2) }} head shook to say no, but I didn’t hear any words. All I heard was the sound of a low motor, not the Pacific, but a real low motor that opened up with a chainsaw sound into a voice – like jaws being torn open and held there. It was the knife. I saw its handle swivel in the backpocket of {{ hisd(son2) }} {{ trousers(son2) }} – it turned to look at me.
It said, “Eat me, Lieutenant.”
I didn’t dare look at it even though its booming voice pounded in my ears. I held out my hand to the {{fisherman}}’s {{ son(son2) }}, and said something to {{ him(son2) }} – I don’t remember what because I never heard it. All I heard was:
“Eat me and be great. I will live between your lungs and I will give your voice a resonance you have never known. Eat me, Lieutenant.”
The {{ boy(son2) }} backed onto the damp, dark parts of the sand. The knife was thunderous and the waves were rocking. {{ He(son2) }} shook {{ hisd(son2) }} head no no no, and then {{ he(son2) }} reached behind {{ hisd(son2) }} back and grabbed the screaming knife and yelled.
When I shot {{ him(son2) }} {{ he(son2) }} was flying toward me with the kris quivering in the sun. I saw all the way into the back of {{ hisd(son2) }} mouth. {{ Hisd(son2) }} body went sloshing to Australia on a bed of foam but the knife stayed, stuck in the sand. Hermit crabs came out of the spot in droves where it burrowed. All up and down the beach it called and called. And I was all alone to listen to the beached monster. I thought this was the end of the world. All I saw was ocean, the color of sky, and all I heard was the dark sound of power being born. I wrapped my hand in cloth and I pulled it out of the sand. There was my face in the blade. By then the knife was no longer articulate. It was just the sound of the great furnace, the great {{God}}, roaring in want. The kind of sound caves make when you are alone inside them. But I did not touch it, I kept my mouth shut, and I put it in a plastic bag.
Then a plane passed overhead. The wolf-dog came lolling over the dunes and I saw the {{fisherman}}’s {{ son(son2) }} rising and falling. {{ He(son2) }} was about the size of a shark fin by then. I climbed back to the palm trees, where the motorbike was.
***
{{Kurang}} broke the kris into manageable pieces. This surprised us, because {{ he(Kurang) }} was a feeble {{ man(Kurang) }}, all bones and no taller than a pony’s shoulder. But {{ he(Kurang) }} split it with {{ hisd(Kurang) }} bare hands and then, panting, told the General to eat.
What if the pieces caught in {{ hisd(General) }} throat?
“They want to be with you,” said {{Kurang}}. {{ He(Kurang) }} leaned over into the light – turned out {{ he(Kurang) }} had a lazy eye that I hadn’t seen before. “{{ Mister(General) }} General, the knife wants to help you.”
The General, who now accidentally spit tiny burning bullets at foot-soldiers when {{ he(General) }} yelled at them during drills and had already blinded one, agreed to partake of the knife with less coaxing than {{Kurang}} needed to get {{ him(General) }} to swallow the bullet. {{ He(General) }} had been paranoid, the past few days, that {{ hisd(General) }} chance to rescue the country was slipping by. {{ He(General) }} thought the President was in talks with Communists and that it would end for all of us. Our jobs, our lives, the bright new tomorrow.
According to the servants {{ he(General) }} had some coughing fits the night after {{ he(General) }} ate the knife. But the very next day {{ he(General) }} made a statement condemning Communists as heathens and urging people not to forget what made this baby country of ours so great: unity, justice, development, democracy, and deference to God. And the everymen said yes. That’s all I heard in the warung over sweet black coffee and kretek, wow, what a smart {{ man(General) }} {{ he(General) }} is. {{ He(General) }}’s got the right idea. I agree completely. The General also slashed the sheets getting out of bed as well as the morning paper, and there was some accident with the family cat – nothing fatal, just a peculiarity.
When I got out of the warung it was like I knew {{Kurang}} would be there, and {{ he(Kurang) }} was, with a smile.
“What does {{ he(General) }} need now?”
“{{ He(General) }} needs protection from death. {{ He(General) }} needs to be able to survive {{ hisd(General) }} enemies’ bang-bangs.” {{ He(Kurang) }} cocked {{ hisd(Kurang) }} head. “{{ He(General) }} wants to be Forever President, Lieutenant. So {{ he(General) }} can fix everything.” Then {{Kurang}} winked. It was insulting and cheap and I tried to hit {{ him(Kurang) }}, I don’t know why. {{ He(Kurang) }} was a dukun, I should have known {{ he(Kurang) }} wouldn’t let me. A blast wave blew up from behind {{ hisd(Kurang) }} left ear and threw me back.
“But the General does want to fix everything,” I said after I got my breath back. “People are tired of being poor and they’re tired of seeing the President blow it on {{ whore-opp(General) }}s and private—”
“Oh yes, monies. They’ll come too. But first things first, Lieutenant, and first {{ he(General) }} needs longevity.” There were definitely things under {{ hisd(Kurang) }} skin, no doubt now – long tape worms pressed up around {{ hisd(Kurang) }} cheeks. Almost like burn-scars but these wobbled, and tonight {{ hisd(Kurang) }} hair was churning too, filled with what looked like fingers. “There is a very old goat that lives in Jogja. {{ Mister(General) }} General will need its liver.”
Before I walked off I looked back at {{Kurang}}, still standing with {{ hisd(Kurang) }} back to me, still wriggling with all the things inside {{ him(Kurang) }}. “Maybe you should see a doctor about that,” I said.
{{ He(Kurang) }} turned around but I can’t say what happened then because I just started to run. I remember for the next week I didn’t look in mirrors and I might as well have been shaving blind. My {{ daughter(daughter) }} saw all the cuts on my face and asked if I had been in a fight with witches. I thought about what to say and finally I said yes. I said yes, I had, I was fighting to protect {{ her(daughter) }}. Then I kissed {{ herd(daughter) }} earlobe and {{ herd(daughter) }} tiny golden earring, and {{ she(daughter) }} gave me another picture. I tried to be proud like when {{ herd(daughter) }} {{brother}} brought home perfect math scores but it was just so horrible. I asked {{ her(daughter) }} what it was. “It’s to protect {{ Daddy(Lieutenant) }},” {{ she(daughter) }} said stubbornly. So I don’t know what it was. There were yellow eyes but there was also an uncooked darkness, and something like a mouth, if those were fangs. I wondered if I should have been grateful. At least {{ she(daughter) }} was drawing faces now.
***
I went by plane. It was not quite Jogja, but a subvillage. I put my hands in my pockets and said I was looking for a very old goat. They thought I wanted to buy it and so they all claimed to own it – or if not a goat, a cow with three horns or a chicken with no head. But then there were the school children. “Is there a very old goat in this village anywhere?” With big malnourished eyes they stared. I gave them money and where they pointed I went.
At a little house, under a spirit-willow, sat a {{ man(Oldman) }} half-blind with age and chemicals, who sang to {{ himself(Oldman) }}. {{ He(Oldman) }} took me to the orange orchard to see the goat, and then stood there whistling by the roadside. The creature hobbled in the grass, gnawing on orange rinds. It was clearly weak but still it wore a loose rope that tied it to a tree.
“You can’t buy it, you know,” said the old {{ man(Oldman) }}, swaying with {{ hisd(Oldman) }} cane. “It’s one with me. It was born the same day I was and I can’t part with it.” It was true, they both had eyes the color of haze, and hair the color of smoked bone. The same awkward gait from back legs that were too long. Maybe they were congenital twins. I took out a cigarette.
“I don’t want to buy it. What do you think would happen if it died?”
“Oh, I don’t think it will. It’s one hundred and two.”
The goat lifted its head and after a search its cataract eyes fell upon me. It was older than my {{ father(Oldman) }}. I couldn’t even imagine a world that old. That was far far before the beginning of time. It outlived the Dutch and the Japanese and the Dutch again. It probably never thought a native {{ son(Lieutenant) }} would harm it. For a moment the cigarette just sat between my lips, dumb and silent. The goat bleated wretchedly. It started stumbling our way, on furbare legs and cracked hooves.
“Maybe it’s tired of life,” I suggested.
“Nonsense,” said the old {{ man(Oldman) }}. “It will live forever.”
I thought about luring it to me with a salty hand and giving it a deceptive calming squeeze before gutting it, but in the end I just grabbed it by the neck, rough and unceremonious, and slit its jugular. Of course I watched sacrifices when I was a {{ boy(Lieutenant) }} but this was profane. I wiped my hands on its fur – sick old blood, it’s the sickest thing – and looked back at the old blind {{ man(Oldman) }}. I already knew {{ he(Oldman) }} was going to die. When the last pumps of life gave from the goat and onto my shoes, the old blind {{ man(Oldman) }} started to bleed. Just then. In the neck. The only body I could drag back was the goat’s and even though it was in a burlap sack the village knew and was silent. I never lit that fucking cigarette.
***
No persuasion was necessary to make the General eat the goat’s well-aged liver. {{ He(General) }} gobbled it down and, when the raw slab went slipping down {{ hisd(General) }} throat, looked up in eagerness. {{Kurang}} patted {{ him(General) }} on the head – no choking this time, it went down easy besides giving {{ him(General) }} a drugged look – and said, “You’re going to be President for a long time, {{ Mister(General) }} General. Maybe fifty years.”
“Fifty?” said the General, and snapped {{ hisd(General) }} fingerblades. A bullet coalesced on {{ hisd(General) }} tongue and {{Kurang}} had to duck to avoid it. “You said I would be President forever!”
“Well, no one can be President forever,” said {{ hisd(General) }} dukun, and gave {{ him(General) }} the glass of tea. “But I promise that you will live forever in their hearts and their history books. You will have the biggest chapter, {{ Mister(General) }} General. Your shadow will loom forever, on monuments, on boulevards. Like Mount Bromo, you will be like Mount Bromo, okay?”
The {{ man(General) }} {{ himself(General) }} had not grown but by dawn {{ he(General) }}’d become impermeable. {{ He(General) }} was a monolith, an impenetrable fortress that was sharp to the touch and spat bullets. {{ He(General) }} fired {{ hisd(General) }} bodyguards. And {{ hisd(General) }} hair turned gray overnight and {{ he(General) }} walked with a strange limp, so {{ he(General) }} put on {{ hisd(General) }} army cap and sat in leather chairs with golden curlicues for feet and looked majestic.
{{Kurang}} was waiting for me when I got home. {{ He(Kurang) }}’d gotten through the peeling front gates somehow and was leaning against an outer wall of the house, just barely out of sight. I threw up my hands.
“There is nothing more {{ he(General) }} needs!”
“{{ He(General) }} wants to be loved.”
I blinked. The sun had turned our garden purple. Everywhere were rainbows. “{{ He(General) }} is loved,” I said. “We love the General. We’ll follow {{ him(General) }} anywhere, to the end of time if we have to.”
“{{ He(General) }} wants to be loved by the people. {{ He(General) }} wants them to look at {{ hisd(General) }} portrait after {{ he(General) }} is gone and think, oh, my {{ father(General) }}, my dead {{ father(General) }}, how your children miss you.” {{ He(Kurang) }} rubbed {{ hisd(Kurang) }} feet together. Something came slithering out from under {{ hisd(Kurang) }} pant leg and it swam through the tiles of our veranda and then dove into a bed of bougainvillea. “Or something like that. {{ He(General) }} wants to have that statue in the center square, with little children on {{ hisd(General) }} arms, like parrots. {{ He(General) }} wants to be shown all smiles. You understand?”
“What is it then that {{ he(General) }} needs to be loved?”
“{{ He(General) }} needs your young {{daughter}}’s heart.”
I walked for hours in the city after {{ he(Kurang) }} told me that. Of course I said no. But {{Kurang}} said, if you don’t do it we’ll find someone else who will, and to have it to headquarters by the beginning of the coup. Three days, {{ he(Kurang) }}’d said and lifted {{ hisd(Kurang) }} fingers with a smile. I walked for hours, me and the legless beggars and the eyeless cats. They reached their limbs out to me and begged me to help them in a way only the General could. And now and then under street lamps, behind minivans, I would see {{Kurang}} with {{ hisd(Kurang) }} fingers raised in a salute. At the end of the first day one of {{ hisd(Kurang) }} fingers fell off, and then there were only two.
Please know this – I loved my {{ daughter }}, love {{ her(daughter) }} still. Please never doubt this. But I did not know what else to do. Yes, I thought about hiding {{ her(daughter) }} away in the mountains, with {{ herd(daughter) }} grandparents, in that village washed up against the Australian sea. But {{ he(Kurang) }} would have found {{ her(daughter) }}. And when I pointed my gun at {{Kurang}} and said leave {{ her(daughter) }} alone or I will shoot, of course my gun jammed. And then I said take my heart instead, but {{Kurang}} said mine was a murderer’s. It wasn’t good enough.
“You can keep your older {{ son(brother) }},” said {{Kurang}}, “and your {{ wife-opp(Lieutenant) }}. Aren’t you willing to sacrifice just this one thing of yours for the good of your people? Selfish selfish, Lieutenant. {{ Men(Lieutenant) }} like you are the reason this country is going to shit.”
I was curled up on the sidewalk beating my head against the concrete and crying, “I can’t, dear {{ God }}, I can’t.”
“Then just bring {{ her(daughter) }} to headquarters. Someone else will do it. You can hold {{ herd(daughter) }} hand.”
When I came home at the end of the second day my {{daughter}} ran to me and wrapped {{ herd(daughter) }} little arms around my legs. “Don’t you have a picture for me today?” I asked; {{ she(daughter) }} said, “I’ve hidden it, {{ Daddy(Lieutenant) }}. You’ll find it later.”
I said we had to go to {{ Daddy(Lieutenant) }}’s office and I held {{ her(daughter) }} very close, close enough to feel that precious heart of {{ hers(daughter) }} rejoicing while mine wept. {{ She(daughter) }} had a strong beat, my little {{ girl(daughter) }}. I knew that before {{ she(daughter) }} was born, when I listened to {{ her(daughter) }} drumming in {{ iczm(Lieutenant) }}. Stronger than mine. And despite the monsters in {{ herd(daughter) }} drawings {{ she(daughter) }} was all smiles, all the time – even that night, as {{ herd(daughter) }} long lashes closed in contentment and {{ she(daughter) }} waited. Dear {{ God}}, Dear {{God}}. Every day I ask {{ her(daughter) }} to forgive me, and every day I pray {{ she(daughter) }} doesn’t.
***
The General became our {{ paterfamilias(General) }}. {{ He(General) }} was painted on billboards with children on {{ hisd(General) }} lap, all of them pointing at some new horizon just over that swath of development projects. People do greet {{ him(General) }} with jubilation, they kiss the rings on {{ hisd(General) }} fingers and thank {{ him(General) }} for all the good {{ he(General) }}’s done. {{ Hisd(General) }} birthday celebrations at the palace are something else, or so I’ve heard.
{{ He(General) }} sends me pictures in manila envelopes. I suspect {{Kurang}} would have advised {{ him(General) }} against it, but {{Kurang}} is dead now. {{ Hisd(Kurang) }} head fell off a couple years back, and it turned out there was nothing inside of {{ him(Kurang) }} but snakes and grubs and centipedes. The General says {{ he(General) }} draws these things late at night and {{ he(General) }} doesn’t know why {{ he(General) }} feels that {{ he(General) }} should send them to me or why they come racing out of {{ hisd(General) }} fingers, but I do, and I tape the monsters up all over the house, over family portraits, over the clock, over the calendar.
And I wait for {{ him(General) }} to die. I know {{ he(General) }}’s a good {{ man(General) }} who’s done good things. {{ God }} only knows {{ he(General) }}’s a better President than that Communist. I just think, maybe when {{ he(General) }}’s dead, {{ he(General) }}’ll give me back {{ herd(daughter) }} heart.
