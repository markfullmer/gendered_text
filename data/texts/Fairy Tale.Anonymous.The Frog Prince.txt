<h1>The Frog {{ Prince(Frog) }}</h1>
One fine evening a young {{ princess(Princess) }} put on {{ herd(Princess) }} bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by {{ herself(Princess) }} in a wood; and when {{ she(Princess) }} came to a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, {{ she(Princess) }} sat {{ herself(Princess) }} down to rest a while. Now {{ she(Princess) }} had a golden ball in {{ herd(Princess) }} hand, which was {{ herd(Princess) }} favourite plaything; and {{ she(Princess) }} was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell. After a time {{ she(Princess) }} threw it up so high that {{ she(Princess) }} missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The {{ princess(Princess) }} looked into the spring after {{ her(Princess) }} ball, but it was very deep, so deep that {{ she(Princess) }} could not see the bottom of it. Then {{ she(Princess) }} began to bewail {{ herd(Princess) }} loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.’
Whilst {{ she(Princess) }} was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, ‘{{ Princess }}, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said {{ she(Princess) }}, ‘what can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’ The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the {{ princess(Princess) }}, ‘this silly frog is talking! {{ He(Frog) }} can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though {{ he(Frog) }} may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell {{ him(Frog) }} {{ he(Frog) }} shall have what {{ he(Frog) }} asks.’ So {{ she(Princess) }} said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put {{ hisd(Frog) }} head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while {{ he(Frog) }} came up again, with the ball in {{ his(Frog) }} mouth, and threw it on the edge of the spring. As soon as the young {{ princess(Princess) }} saw {{ her(Princess) }} ball, {{ she(Princess) }} ran to pick it up; and {{ she(Princess) }} was so overjoyed to have it in {{ her(Princess) }} hand again, that {{ she(Princess) }} never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as {{ she(Princess) }} could. The frog called after {{ her(Princess) }}, ‘Stay, {{ princess(Princess) }}, and take me with you as you said,’ But {{ she(Princess) }} did not stop to hear a word.
The next day, just as the {{ princess(Princess) }} had sat down to dinner, {{ she(Princess) }} heard a strange noise—tap, tap—plash, plash—as if something was coming up the marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the door, and a little voice cried out and said:
‘Open the door, my {{ princess(Princess) }} dear,
Open the door to thy true love here!
And mind the words that thou and I said
By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’
Then the {{ princess(Princess) }} ran to the door and opened it, and there {{ she(Princess) }} saw the frog, whom {{ she(Princess) }} had quite forgotten. At this sight {{ she(Princess) }} was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as {{ she(Princess) }} could came back to {{ her(Princess) }} seat. The {{ king(King) }}, {{ herd(Princess) }} {{ father(King) }}, seeing that something had frightened {{ her(Princess) }}, asked {{ her(Princess) }} what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said {{ she(Princess) }}, ‘at the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I told {{ him(Frog) }} that {{ he(Frog) }} should live with me here, thinking that {{ he(Frog) }} could never get out of the spring; but there {{ he(Frog) }} is at the door, and {{ he(Frog) }} wants to come in.’
While {{ she(Princess) }} was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:
‘Open the door, my {{ princess(Princess) }} dear,
Open the door to thy true love here!
And mind the words that thou and I said
By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’
Then the {{ king(King) }} said to the young {{ princess(Princess) }}, ‘As you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let {{ him(Frog) }} in.’ {{ She(Princess) }} did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and then straight on—tap, tap—plash, plash—from the bottom of the room to the top, till {{ he(Frog) }} came up close to the table where the {{ princess(Princess) }} sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said {{ he(Frog) }} to the {{ princess(Princess) }}, ‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as {{ she(Princess) }} had done this, the frog said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This {{ she(Princess) }} did, and when {{ he(Frog) }} had eaten as much as {{ he(Frog) }} could, {{ he(Frog) }} said, ‘Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the {{ princess(Princess) }}, though very unwilling, took {{ him(Frog) }} up in {{ her(Princess) }} hand, and put {{ him(Frog) }} upon the pillow of {{ her(Princess) }} own bed, where {{ he(Frog) }} slept all night long. As soon as it was light {{ he(Frog) }} jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house. ‘Now, then,’ thought the {{ princess(Princess) }}, ‘at last {{ he(Frog) }} is gone, and I shall be troubled with {{ him(Frog) }} no more.’
But {{ she(Princess) }} was mistaken; for when night came again {{ she(Princess) }} heard the same tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:
‘Open the door, my {{ princess(Princess) }} dear,
Open the door to thy true love here!
And mind the words that thou and I said
By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’
And when the {{ princess(Princess) }} opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon {{ her(Princess) }} pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night {{ he(Frog) }} did the same. But when the {{ princess(Princess) }} awoke on the following morning {{ she(Princess) }} was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome {{ prince(Frog) }}, gazing on {{ her(Princess) }} with the most beautiful eyes {{ she(Princess) }} had ever seen, and standing at the head of {{ her(Princess) }} bed.
{{ He(Frog) }} told {{ her(Princess) }} that {{ he(Princess) }} had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed {{ him(Frog) }} into a frog; and that {{ he(Frog) }} had been fated so to abide till some {{ princess(Princess) }} should take {{ him(Frog) }} out of the spring, and let {{ him(Frog) }} eat from {{ her(Princess) }} plate, and sleep upon {{ her(Princess) }} bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the {{ prince(Frog) }}, ‘have broken {{ his(Fairy) }} cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will marry you, and love you as long as you live.’
The young {{ princess(Princess) }}, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind the coach rode the {{ prince(Frog) }}’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed the misfortunes of {{ his(Heinrich) }} dear master during {{ hisd(Frog) }} enchantment so long and so bitterly, that {{ his(Heinrich) }} heart had well-nigh burst.
They then took leave of the {{ king(King) }}, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the {{ prince(Frog) }}’s kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years.
