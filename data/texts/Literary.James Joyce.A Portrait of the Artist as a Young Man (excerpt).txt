Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little {{ boy(boy) }} named baby tuckoo....
{{ Hisd(boy) }} {{ father(father1) }} told {{ him(boy) }} that story: {{ hisd(boy) }} {{ father(father1) }} looked at {{ him(boy) }} through a glass: {{ he(father1) }} had a {{ hairy(father1) }} face.
{{ He(boy) }} was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.
<em>O, the wild rose blossoms on the little green place.</em>
{{ He(boy) }} sang that song. That was {{ hisd(boy) }} song.
<em>O, the green wothe botheth.</em>
When you wet the bed, first it is warm then it gets cold. {{ Hisd(boy) }} {{ mother(mother2) }} put on the oilsheet. That had the queer smell.
{{ Hisd(boy) }} {{ mother(mother2) }} had a nicer smell than {{ hisd(boy) }} {{ father(father1) }}. {{ She(mother2) }} played on the piano the sailorâ€™s hornpipe for {{ him(boy) }} to dance.
