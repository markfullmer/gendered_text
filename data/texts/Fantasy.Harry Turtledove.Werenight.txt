<h2>I</h2>
"{{Duin}}, you're a damned fool if you think you can fight from horseback," {{Drago}} the Bear said, tossing a gnawed bone to {{ hisd(Drago) }} trencher.
{{Duin}} the Bold slammed {{ hisd(Duin) }} tankard down on the long table. Ale slopped over the rim. "Fool, is it?" {{ he(Duin) }} shouted, {{ hisd(Duin) }} fair face reddening. "You're the fool, you thickskulled muckbrain!"
{{Drago}} stormed up with an oath, murder in {{ hisd(Drago) }} eyes. {{ Hisd(Drago) }} thick arms groped toward {{Duin}}. The slimmer {{ man(Duin) }} skipped back. {{ Hisd(Duin) }} hand flashed to {{ hisd(Duin) }} swordhilt. Cries of anger and alarm rang through Castle Fox's great hall.
{{Gerin}} the Fox, {{ baron(Gerin) }} of Fox Keep, sprang to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} feet. "Stop it!" {{ he(Gerin) }} shouted. The shout froze both angry retainers for a moment, giving their benchmates a chance to crowd between them. {{Drago}} sent one flying with a shrug of {{ hisd(Drago) }} massive shoulders, but was brought up short by a grip not even {{ hisd(Drago) }} massive thews could break. {{Van}} of the Strong Arm grinned down at {{ him(Drago) }}. Almost a foot taller than the squat Bear, the outlander was every bit as powerfully made.
{{Gerin}} glowered at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fractious vassals, disgust plain in every line of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} lean body. The warriors grew shamefaced under {{ hisd(Gerin) }} glare. Nothing would have pleased {{ him(Gerin) }} more than breaking both their stupid heads. {{ He(Gerin) }} lashed them with {{ hisd(Gerin) }} voice instead, snapping, "I called you here to fight the Trokmoi, not each other. The woodsrunners will be a tough enough nut to crack without us squabbling among ourselves."
"Then let us fight them!" {{Duin}} said, but {{ hisd(Duin) }} blade was back in its scabbard. "This {{Dyaus}}-damned rain has cooped us up here for ten days now. No wonder we're quarreling like so many snapping turtles in a pot. Turn us loose, {{ lord(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}!" To that even {{Drago}} rumbled agreement. {{ He(Drago) }} was not alone.
The Fox shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. "If we try to cross the River Niffet in this weather, either current or storm will surely swamp us. When the sky clears, we move. Not before."
Privately, {{Gerin}} was more worried than {{ hisd(Gerin) }} followers, but {{ he(Gerin) }} did not want them to see that. Since spring {{ he(Gerin) }}'d been sure the northern barbarians were planning to swarm south over the Niffet and ravage {{ hisd(Gerin) }} holding. {{ He(Gerin) }}'d decided to strike first.
But this downpour—worse than any {{ he(Gerin) }} could remember in all {{ hisd(Gerin) }} thirty years on the northern marches of the Empire of Elabon—balked {{ hisd(Gerin) }} plans. For ten days {{ he(Gerin) }}'d had no glimpse of sun, moons, or stars. Even the Niffet, a scant half mile away, was hard to spy.
Rumor also said the Trokmoi had a new {{ wizard(Balamung) }} of great power. More than once, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had seen fell lights dancing deep within the northern forests. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} ever-suspicious mind found it all too easy to blame the Trokmê mage for the rude weather.
{{Duin}} started to protest further. Then {{ he(Duin) }} saw the scar over {{Gerin}}'s right eye go pale: a sure danger signal. The words stayed bottled in {{ hisd(Duin) }} throat. {{ He(Duin) }} made sheepish apologies to {{Drago}}, who frowned but, under {{Gerin}}'s implacable gaze, nodded and clasped {{ hisd(Drago) }} hand.
As calm descended, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} took a long pull at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own ale. It was late. {{ He(Gerin) }} was tired, but {{ he(Gerin) }} was not eager for bed. {{ hisd(Gerin) }} chamber was on the second floor, and the roof leaked.
Siglorel Shelofas' {{ son(wizard1) }}, when sober the best Elabonian {{ wizard(wizard1) }} north of the High Kirs, had set a five-year calking spell on it only the summer before, but the old sot must have had a bad day. Water trickled through the roofing and collected in cold puddles on the upper story's floor. Spread rushes did little to soak it up.
{{Gerin}} plucked at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} neat black {{ beard(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} wished for carpets like those {{ he(Gerin) }} had known in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} younger days south of the mountains. Study was all {{ he(Gerin) }}'d lived for then, and the barony the furthest thing from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind. {{ He(Gerin) }} remembered the fiasco that had resulted when exasperation drove {{ him(Gerin) }} to try the book of spells {{ he(Gerin) }}'d brought north from the capital.
History and natural lore had always interested {{ him(Gerin) }} more than magecraft. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} studies at the Sorcerers' Collegium began late and, worse, were cut short after fewer than a hundred days: a Trokmê ambush took both {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ father(Duren) }} and elder {{ brother(Dagref) }}, leaving {{ him(Gerin) }} the unexpected {{ master(Gerin) }} of Fox Keep.
In the eight years since, {{ he(Gerin) }}'d had little cause to try wizardry. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} skill was not large. Nor did age improve it: {{ hisd(Gerin) }} incantation raised nothing but a cloud of stinking black smoke and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} vassals' hackles. On the whole, {{ he(Gerin) }} counted {{ himself(Gerin) }} lucky. Amateur wizards who played with forces stronger than they could control often met unpleasant ends.
A snatch of drunken song made {{ him(Gerin) }} look up. {{Duin}} and {{Drago}} sat with their arms round each other's shoulders, boasting of the havoc they would wreak among the Trokmoi when the cursed weather finally cleared. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} was relieved. They were two of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} stoutest fighters.
{{ He(Gerin) }} drained {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mug and rose to receive the salutes of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} vassals. Head buzzing slightly, {{ he(Gerin) }} climbed the soot-grimed oak stairway to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bedchamber. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} last waking thought was a prayer to {{Dyaus}} for fair weather so {{ he(Gerin) }} could add another chapter to the vengeance {{ he(Gerin) }} was taking on the barbarians. . . .
* * *
A horn cried danger from the watchtower, tumbling {{ him(Gerin) }} from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bed with the least ceremony imaginable. {{ He(Gerin) }} cursed the bronzen clangor as {{ he(Gerin) }} stumbled to a window. "If that overeager lackwit up there is tootling for {{ hisd(retainer1) }} amusement, I'll have {{ hisd(retainer1) }} ears," {{ he(Gerin) }} muttered to {{ himself(Gerin) }}. But the scar over {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eyes throbbed and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fingers were nervous in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ beard(Gerin) }}. If the Trokmoi had found a way to cross the Niffet in the rain, no telling how much damage they might do.
The window was only a north-facing slit, intended more for shooting arrows than sight. The little {{Gerin}} saw was enough. Jabbing forks of lightning revealed hand after hand of Trokmoi, all searching for something to carry off or, failing that, to burn. The wind blew snatches of their lilting speech to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ears.
"May the gods fry you, {{Aingus}}, you tricky {{ bastard(Aingus) }}, and your pet {{ wizard(wizard2) }} too," {{Gerin}} growled. {{ He(Gerin) }} wondered how the Trokmê chieftain had got so many {{ men(vassals) }} across the river so fast. Then {{ he(Gerin) }} raised {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eyes further and saw the bridge bulking impossibly huge over the Niffet.
It had to be sorcerous: a silvery band of light leading from the northern woods into {{Gerin}}'s holding. It had not been there when the {{ baron(Gerin) }} went to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} rest. As {{ he(Gerin) }} watched, Trokmê nobles poured over it in their chariots, retainers loping beside them. Once long ago, {{Gerin}} thought, {{ he(Gerin) }} had read something of such spans. {{ He(Gerin) }} could not recall where or when, but the half-memory sent a pang of fear icing up {{ hisd(Gerin) }} spine.
No time for such worries now. {{ He(Gerin) }} hurled {{ himself(Gerin) }} into {{ trousers(Gerin) }} and hobnailed sandals, buckled on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sword, and rushed down dim-lit passageway and creaking stair to the great hall, where {{ hisd(Gerin) }} vassals had hung their corselets when they arrived. That hall was a swearing jumble of {{ men(vassals ) }} donning bronze-faced leather cuirasses and kilts, strapping on greaves, jamming pot-shaped helms onto their heads, and fouling each other as they waved spears in the air. Like {{Gerin}}, most had skin that took the sun well and dark hair and eyes, but a few freckled faces and light beards told of northern blood—{{Duin}}, for one, was fair as any Trokmê.
"Ho, captain!" {{Van}} of the Strong Arm boomed. "Thought you'd never get here!"
Even in the rowdy crew {{Gerin}} led, {{Van}} stood out. Taller than the Fox by as many inches, {{ he(Van) }} was broad enough not to look {{ hisd(Van) }} height. A sword-cut creased {{ hisd(Van) }} nose and disappeared into the sun-colored mat of {{ beard(Van) }} covering most of {{ hisd(Van) }} neck. Little hellish lights flickered in {{ hisd(Van) }} blue eyes.
{{ Hisd(Van) }} gear was as remarkable as {{ hisd(Van) }} person, for {{ hisd(Van) }} back-and-breast was cast of two solid pieces of bronze. Not even the {{Emperor}} had a finer one. Unlike the businesslike helms {{ hisd(Van) }} comrades wore, {{Van}}'s was a fantastic affair with a scarlet horsehair plume nodding above {{ hisd(Van) }} head and leather cheekpieces to protect {{ hisd(Van) }} face. Looking more war-{{ god(Van) }} than {{ man(Van) }}, {{ he(Van) }} shook a spear like a young tree.
If {{ hisd(Van) }} tale was true, {{ he(Van) }}'d been trying to cross the Trokmê forests from north to south, and had all but done it till {{ he(Van) }} fell foul of {{Aingus}}' clan. But {{ he(Van) }}'d escaped them too, and had enough left in {{ hisd(Van) }} giant frame to swim the Niffet, towing {{ hisd(Van) }} precious armor behind {{ him(Van) }} on a makeshift raft.
{{ Hisd(Van) }} strength, bluff good humor, and wide-ranging stories (told in the forest tongue until {{ he(Van) }} learned Elabonian) had won {{ him(Van) }} a home at Fox Keep for as long as {{ he(Van) }} wanted to stay. But when {{Gerin}} asked {{ him(Van) }} {{ hisd(Van) }} homeland, {{ he(Van) }} politely declined to answer. The Fox did not ask twice; if {{Van}} did not want to talk, it was {{ hisd(Van) }} affair. That had been only two years ago, {{Gerin}} thought with a twinge of surprise. {{ He(Gerin) }} had trouble remembering what life had been like without {{ hisd(Gerin) }} burly friend at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} side.
The Fox's own armor was of the plainest, leather much patched, plates battered and nicked. The leather was firm and supple, though, and every plate sound. To {{Gerin}}'s way of thinking, the figure {{ he(Gerin) }} cut was less important than staying alive {{ himself(Gerin) }} and putting a quick end to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} foes.
The warriors wallowed through thick mud to the stables. It squelched underfoot, trying to suck their sandals and boots into its cold, slimy mouth. The chaos was worse inside the stables, as {{ boys(vassals) }} tried to hitch unwilling horses to their betters’ chariots.
{{Gerin}} strung {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bow and stowed in on the right side of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} car next to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} quiver; on the left went an axe. Like many of the Fox's vassals, {{Van}} affected to despise the bow as an un{{ man(Van) }}ly weapon. {{ He(Van) }} bore sword, dagger, and a wickedly spiked mace on {{ hisd(Van) }} belt.
{{ Hisd(Van) }} shield and the Fox's, yard-wide discs of bronze-faced wood and leather, topped the car's low sidewalls when put in their brackets. {{Gerin}}'s was deliberately dull, Van's burnished bright. Despite their contrasting styles, the two formed one of the most feared teams on the border.
{{Gerin}}'s driver, a gangling {{ youth(Raffo) }} named {{Raffo}}, leaped into the chariot. A six-foot shield of heavy leather was slung on a baldric over {{ hisd(Raffo) }} left shoulder. It gave {{Gerin}} cover from which to shoot. Taking up the reins, {{Raffo}} skillfully picked {{ hisd(Raffo) }} way through the confusion.
After what seemed far too much time to the Fox, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ men(vassals) }} gathered in loose formation just behind the gatehouse. Shrieks from beyond the keep told plain as need be that the Trokmoi were plundering {{ hisd(Gerin) }} serfs. Archers on the palisade kept up a sputtering duel with the barbarians, targets limited to those the lightning showed.
At {{Gerin}}'s shouted command, the gatehouse crew flung wide the strong-hinged gates and let the drawbridge thump down. The chariots lumbered into action, trailing mucky wakes. {{Van}}'s bellowed oaths cut off in midword when {{ he(Van) }} saw the bridge. "By my {{ beard(Van) }}," {{ he(Van) }} grunted, "where did it come from?"
"Magicked up, without a doubt." {{Gerin}} wished {{ he(Gerin) }} were as calm as {{ he(Gerin) }} sounded. No Trokmê hedge-wizard could have called that spell into being—nor could the elegant and talented mages of the Sorcerer's Guild down in the capital.
An arrow whizzing past {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ear shattered {{ hisd(Gerin) }} brief reverie. Trokmoi swarmed out of the peasant village to meet {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fighters. They had no mind to let their looting be stopped. "{{Aingus}}!" they shouted, and "{{Balamung}}!"—a name the Fox did not know. The Elabonians roared back: "{{Gerin}} the Fox!" The two bands met in bloody collision.
A northerner appeared at the left side of the Fox's chariot, sword in hand. The rain plastered {{ hisd(northerner) }} long red hair and flowing {{ mustach2(northerner) }} against {{ hisd(northerner) }} head; {{ he(northerner) }} wore no helm. The reek of ale was thick about {{ him(northerner) }}.
Reading {{ hisd(northerner) }} mind was easy. {{Van}} would have to twist {{ hisd(Van) }} body to use {{ hisd(Van) }} spear, {{Raffo}} had {{ hisd(Raffo) }} hands full, and {{Gerin}}, who had just shot, could never get off another arrow before the Trokmê's blade pierced {{ him(Gerin) }}. Feeling like a gambler playing with loaded dice, the Fox snatched up {{ hisd(Gerin) }} axe with {{ hisd(Gerin) }} left hand. {{ He(Gerin) }} drove it into the barbarian's skull. The Trokmê toppled, a look of outraged surprise still on {{ hisd(northerner) }} face.
{{Van}} exploded into laughter. "What a rare sneaky thing it must be to be left-handed," {{ he(Van) }} said.
More barbarians were hustling stolen cattle, pigs, sheep, and serfs across the gleaming bridge to their homeland. The villeins had no chance against the northern wolves. Huddled in their huts against the storm and the wandering ghosts of the night, they were easy meat. A few had tried to fight. Their crumpled bodies lay beside their homes. Sickle, flail, and scythe were no match for the sword, spear, bow, and armor of the Trokmê nobles, though their retainers were often little better armed than the peasants.
{{Gerin}} almost felt pity as {{ he(Gerin) }} drove an arrow into one of those retainers and watched {{ him(barbarian1) }} thrash {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} life away. {{ He(Gerin) }} knew the northerner would have had no second thoughts about gutting {{ him(Gerin) }}.
A few Trokmoi had managed to light torches despite the downpour. They smoked and sputtered in the woodsrunners' hands. The rain, though, made the thatched roofs and wattle walls of the cottages all but impossible to light.
With a wave and a shout, {{Gerin}} sent half {{ hisd(Gerin) }} chariots after the pillagers. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} own car was in the middle of the village when {{ he(Gerin) }} shouted, "Pull up!"
{{Raffo}} obediently slowed. {{Gerin}} slung {{ hisd(Gerin) }} quiver over {{ hisd(Gerin) }} shoulder. {{ He(Gerin) }} and {{Van}} slid their shields onto their arms and leaped into the mire. {{Raffo}} wheeled the horses and made for the safety of Fox Keep's walls. The chariot-riders not chasing looters followed the Fox to the ground. Panting footsoldiers rushed up to stiffen their line.
A Trokmê sprang on the {{ baron(Gerin) }}'s back before {{ he(Gerin) }} could find {{ hisd(Gerin) }} footing in the mud. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} bow flew from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hand. The two struggling fighters fell together. The barbarian's dagger sought {{Gerin}}'s heart, but was foiled by {{ hisd(Gerin) }} cuirass. {{ He(Gerin) }} jabbed an elbow into the Trokmê's unarmored middle. The {{ fellow(barbarian1) }} grunted and loosened {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} grasp.
Both scrambled to their feet. {{Gerin}} was quicker. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} foot lashed out in a roundhouse kick. The spiked sole of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sandal ripped away half the Trokmê's face. With a dreadful wail, the marauder sprawled in the ooze, {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} features a gory mask.
{{Duin}} the Bold thundered by on a horse. Though {{ hisd(Duin) }} legs were clenched round its barrel, {{ he(Duin) }} still wobbled on the beast's bare back. Since a rider did not have both hands free to use a bow and could not deliver any sort of spearthrust without going over {{ hisd(Duin) }} horse's tail, {{Gerin}} thought fighting from horseback a foolish notion.
But {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fierce little vassal clung to the idea with the tenacity of a bear-baiting dog. {{Duin}} cut down one startled Trokmê with {{ hisd(Duin) }} sword. When {{ he(Duin) }} slashed at another, the northerner ducked under {{ hisd(Duin) }} stroke and gave {{ him(Duin) }} a hefty push. {{ He(Duin) }} fell in the mud with a splash. The horse fled. The Trokmê was bending over {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} prostrate victim when an Elabonian with a mace stove in {{ hisd(retainer1) }} skull from behind.
{{Van}} was in {{ hisd(Van) }} element. Never happier than when on the field, {{ he(Van) }} howled a battle song in a language {{Gerin}} did not know. {{ Hisd(Van) }} spear drank the blood of one {{ mustachioed(barbarian1)}} barbarian. Panther-quick, {{ he(Van) }} brought its bronze-shod butt back to smash the teeth of another raider who thought to take {{ him(Van) }} from behind.
A third Trokmê rushed at {{ him(Van) }} with an axe. The barbarian's wild swipe went wide, as did {{Van}}'s answering thrust. The impulse of the blows left them chest to chest. {{Van}} dropped {{ hisd(Van) }} spear and seized the barbarian's neck with {{ hisd(Van) }} huge fist. {{ He(Van) }} shook {{ him(barbarian1) }} once, as a dog does a rat. Bones snapped. The Trokmê went limp. Van flung {{ him(barbarian1) }} aside.
{{Gerin}} did not share {{ hisd(Gerin) }} comrade's red joy in slaughter. The main satisfaction {{ he(Gerin) }} took from killing was the knowledge that the shuddering corpse at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} feet was one enemy who would never trouble {{ him(Gerin) }} again. As far as {{ he(Gerin) }} could, {{ he(Gerin) }} stood aloof from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fellow nobles’ internecine quarrels. {{ He(Gerin) }} fought only when provoked, and was fell enough to be provoked but seldom.
Toward the Trokmoi, though, {{ he(Gerin) }} bore a cold, bitter hatred. At first, it had been fueled by the slaying of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ father(Duren) }} and {{ brother(Dagref) }}, but now revenge was only a small part of it. The woodsrunners lived only to destroy. All too often, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} border holding tasted of that destruction as it shielded the softer, more civilized southlands from the sudden bite of arrows and the baying of barbarians in the night.
Almost without thinking, {{ he(Gerin) }} ducked under a flung stone. Another glanced from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} helmet and filled {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head with a brief shower of stars. A spear grazed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} thigh; an arrow pierced {{ hisd(Gerin) }} shield but was turned by {{ hisd(Gerin) }} corselet.
{{ Hisd(Gerin) }} archers shot back, filling the air with death. Spouting bodies disappeared in the mud, to be trampled by friend and foe alike. The Trokmoi swarmed round {{Gerin}}'s armored troopers like snarling wolves round bears, but little by little they were driven back from the village toward their bridge. Their chieftains fought back, making fierce charges across the Fox's fertile wheatfields, crushing {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ men(vassals) }} beneath the flailing hooves of their woods ponies, sending yard-long arrows through cuirasses into soft flesh, and lopping off arms and heads with their great slashing swords.
At their fore was {{Aingus}}. {{ He(Aingus) }} had led {{ hisd(Aingus) }} clan for nearly as long as {{Gerin}} had been alive, but {{ hisd(Aingus) }} splendid red {{ mustachioes(Aingus) }} were unfrosted. Almost as tall as {{Van}}, if less wide through the shoulders, {{ he(Aingus) }} was proud in gilded armor and wheel-crested bronze helm. Golden fylfots and the ears of {{ men(vassals) }} {{ he(Aingus) }} had slain adorned {{ hisd(Aingus) }} chariot. {{ Hisd(Aingus) }} right hand held a dripping sword, {{ hisd(Aingus) }} left the head of an Elabonian who had tried to stand against {{ him(Aingus) }}.
{{ Hisd(Aingus) }} long, knobby-cheekboned face split in a grin when {{ he(Aingus) }} spied {{Gerin}}. "It's {{ himself(Gerin) }} {{ himself(Gerin) }}," {{ he(Aingus) }} roared, "come to be corbies' meat like {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ father(Duren) }}. Thinking to be a {{ man(Gerin) }} before your ape of a friend, are you, {{ lad (Gerin) }}?" {{ Hisd(Aingus) }} Elabonian was fluent enough, though flavored by {{ hisd(Aingus) }} own tongue.
{{Van}} shouted back at {{ him(Aingus) }}; {{Gerin}}, silent, set {{ himself(Gerin) }} for the charge. {{Aingus}} swung up {{ hisd(Aingus) }} sword. {{ Hisd(Aingus) }} driver, a gaunt, black-robed {{ man(Raffo) }} the Fox did not know, whipped {{ hisd(Raffo) }} beasts forward.
On came the chariot, its horses' hooves pounding like doom. {{Gerin}} was lifting {{ hisd(Gerin) }} shield to beat back {{Aingus}}' first mighty stroke when {{Van}}'s spear flashed over {{ hisd(Van) }} shoulder and took one of the onrushing ponies full in the chest.
With the awful scream only wounded horses make, the shaggy pony reared and then fell. It dragged its harness-mate down with it. The chariot overturned and shattered, sending one wheel flying and spilling both riders into the muck.
{{Gerin}} ran forward to finish {{Aingus}}. The Trokmê lit rolling and rushed to meet {{ him(Gerin) }}. "A fine thing will your skull be over my gate," {{ he(Gerin) }} shouted. Then their blades joined with a clash of sparks and there was no more time for words.
Slashing and chopping, {{Aingus}} surged forward, trying to overwhelm {{ hisd(Aingus) }} smaller foe at the first onset. {{Gerin}} parried desperately. Had any of the Trokmê's cuts landed, {{ he(Gerin) }} would have been cut in two. When {{Aingus}}' blade bit so deep into the edge of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} shield that it stuck for a moment, the Fox seized the chance for a thrust of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own. {{Aingus}} knocked the questing point aside with a dagger in {{ hisd(Aingus) }} left hand; {{ he(Aingus) }} had lost {{ hisd(Aingus) }} bloody trophy when the chariot foundered.
The barbarian would not tire. {{Gerin}}'s sword was heavy in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hands, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} battered shield a lump of lead on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} arm, but {{Aingus}} only grew stronger. {{ He(Aingus) }} was bleeding from a cut under {{ hisd(Aingus) }} chin and another on {{ hisd(Aingus) }} arm, but {{ hisd(Aingus) }} attack never slowed.
Crash! Crash! An overhand blow smashed the Fox's shield to kindling. The next ripped through {{ hisd(Gerin) }} armor and drew a track of fire down {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ribs. {{ He(Gerin) }} groaned and sank to one knee.
Thinking {{ him(Gerin) }} finished, the Trokmê loomed over {{ him(Gerin) }}, eager to take {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. But {{Gerin}} was not yet done. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} sword shot up and out with all the force of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} body behind it. The point tore out {{Aingus}}' throat. Dark in the gloom, {{ hisd(Aingus) }} lifeblood fountained forth as {{ he(Aingus) }} fell, both hands clutching futilely at {{ hisd(Aingus) }} neck.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} dragged {{ himself(Gerin) }} to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} feet. {{Van}} came up beside {{ him(Gerin) }}. There was a fresh cut on {{ hisd(Van) }} forearm, but {{ hisd(Van) }} mace dripped blood and brains and {{ hisd(Van) }} face was wreathed in smiles. {{ He(Van) }} brandished the gory weapon and shouted, "Come on, captain! We've broken them!"
"Is it to go through me you're thinking?"
{{Gerin}}'s head jerked up. The Trokmê voice seemed to have come from beside {{ him(Gerin) }}, but the only northerner within fifty yards was {{Aingus}}' scrawny driver. {{ He(Balamung) }} wore no armor under {{ hisd(Balamung) }} sodden robes and carried no weapon, but {{ he(Balamung) }} strode forward with the confidence of a demigod.
"Stand aside, fool," {{Gerin}} said. "I have no stomach for killing an unarmed {{ man(Balamung) }}."
"Then have not a care in the world, southron darling, for I'll be the death of you and not the other way round at all." Lightning cracked, giving {{Gerin}} a glimpse of the northerner's pale skin stretched drumhead tight over skull and jaw. Like a cat's, the {{ fellow(Balamung) }}'s eyes gave back the light in a green flash.
{{ He(Balamung) }} raised {{ hisd(Balamung) }} arms and began to chant. An invocation poured forth, sonorous and guttural. {{Gerin}}'s blood froze in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} veins as {{ he(Gerin) }} recognized the magic-steeped speech of the dreaming river valleys of ancient Kizzuwatna. {{ He(Gerin) }} knew that tongue, and knew it did not belong in the mouth of a swaggering woodsrunner.
The Trokmê dropped {{ hisd(Balamung) }} hands, screaming, "Ethrog, O Luhuzantiyas!"
A horror from the hells of the haunted east appeared before {{ him(Gerin) }}. Its legs, torso, and head were human, the face even grimly handsome: swarthy, hooknosed, and proud, {{ beard(Luhuzantiyas) }} falling in curling ringlets over broad chest. But its arms were the snapping chelae of a monster scorpion. A scorpion's jointed tail grew from the base of its spine, sting gleaming at the tip. With a bellow that should have come from the throat of a bull, the demon {{Luhuzantiyas}} sprang at {{Gerin}} and Van.
It was a nightmare fight. Quicker on its feet than any human, the demon used its tail like a living spear. The sting flashed past {{Gerin}}'s face, so close that {{ he(Gerin) }} caught the acrid reek of its poison. It scored a glittering line across {{Van}}'s corselet. Those terrible claws chewed the outlander's shield to bits. Only a backward leap saved {{ hisd(Gerin) }} arm.
{{ He(Van) }} and {{Gerin}} landed blow after blow, but the demon would not go down, though dark ichor pumped from a score of wounds and one claw was sheared away. Not until {{Van}}, with a strength born of loathing, smashed its skull and face to bloody pulp with frenzied strokes of {{ hisd(Van) }} mace did it fall. Even then it writhed and thrashed in the mire, still seeking its foes.
{{Gerin}} drew in a long, shuddering breath. "Now, {{ wizard(Balamung) }}," {{ he(Gerin) }} grated, "join your devil in the fiery pit that spawned it."
The Trokmê had put twenty or so paces between {{ himself(Balamung) }} and the Fox. {{ Hisd(Balamung) }} laugh—an unclean chuckle that scraped across {{Gerin}}'s nerves—made plain {{ hisd(Gerin) }} lack of fear. "It's a strong {{ man(Gerin) }} you are, {{ lord(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}} the Fox"—the contempt {{ he(Balamung) }} packed into that stung—"and this day is yours. But we'll meet again; aye, indeed we will. My name, {{ lord(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}, is {{Balamung}}. Mark it well, for you've heard it twice the now, and hear it again you will."
"Twice?" {{Gerin}} only whispered it, but {{Balamung}} heard.
"Not even remembering, are you? Well, 'twas three years gone by I came south, having it in mind to take up sorcery. You made me sleep in the stables, with the reeking horses and all, for some fatgut from the south and a party of pimps filled the keep all to bursting, you said. When the next time comes for me to sleep at Fox Keep—and 'twill be soon—I shan't bed in the stables.
"So south I fared, stinking of horsedung, and in Elabon the town only their hinder parts did the Sorcerers' Collegium show me. They called me savage, and that to my face, mind! After you, it's them to pay their price.
"For, you see, quit I didna. I wandered through desert and mountain, and learned from mages and grizzled hermits and squinting scribes who cared nought about a 'rentice's accent, so long as {{ he(Balamung) }} did their bidding. And in a cave lost in the snows of the High Kirs, far above one of the passes the Empire blocked, I found what I had learned to seek: the Book of Shabeth-Shiri the {{ sorcerer(Shabeth-Shiri) }}-{{ king(Shabeth-Shiri) }} of Kizzuwatna long ago.
"{{ Himself (Shabeth-Shiri) }} had died there. When I took the Book from {{ hisd(Shabeth-Shiri) }} dead fingers, {{ he(Shabeth-Shiri) }} turned to a puff of smoke and blew away. And today the Book is mine, and tomorrow the northlands—and after that, the world is none too big!"
"You lie," {{Gerin}} said. "All you will own is a nameless grave, with no one to comfort your shade."
{{Balamung}} laughed again. Now {{ hisd(Balamung) }} eyes flamed red, with a fire of their own. "Wrong you are, for the stars tell me no grave will ever hold me. They tell me more, too, for they show me the gates of your precious keep all beat to flinders, and that inside two turns of the bloody second moon."
"You lie," {{Gerin}} growled again. {{ He(Gerin) }} ran forward, ignoring the pain that lanced up from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} wound. {{Balamung}} stood watching {{ him(Gerin) }}, hands on hips. The Fox lifted {{ hisd(Gerin) }} blade. {{Balamung}} was unmoving, even when it came hissing down to cleave {{ him(Balamung) }} from crown to breastbone.
The stroke met empty air—like the light of a candle suddenly snuffed, the {{ wizard(Balamung) }} was gone. {{Gerin}} staggered and almost fell. {{Balamung}}'s derisive laugh rang in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ears for a long moment, then it too faded. "{{ Father(Dyaus) }} {{Dyaus}} above!" the shaken Fox said again.
{{Van}} muttered an oath in an unknown tongue. "Well, captain," {{ he(Van) }} said, "there's your {{ warlock(Balamung) }}."
{{Gerin}} did not argue.
The Trokmoi seemed to lose their nerve when the {{ sorcerer(Balamung) }} disappeared. Faster and faster they streamed over {{Balamung}}'s bridge, their feet silent on its misty surface. Only a snarling rearguard held {{Gerin}}'s {{ men(vassals) }} at bay. Those warriors slipped away to safety one by one. With deep-throated roars of triumph, the Elabonians swarmed after them.
Like a phantasm compounded of coils of smoke, the bridge vanished. Soldiers screamed as they plunged into the foaming Niffet, the bronze they wore for safety dragging them to a watery doom. On the shore, fighters doffed armor with frantic haste and splashed into the water to save their comrades. Jeering Trokmoi on the northern bank shot at victims and rescuers alike.
It took two soldiers to save {{Duin}}. Impetuous as always, {{ he(Duin) }} had been farthest along the bridge when it evaporated, and {{ he(Duin) }} could not swim. Somehow {{ he(Duin) }} managed to stay afloat until the first rescuer reached {{ him(Duin) }}, but {{ hisd(Duin) }} grip was so desperate that {{ he(Duin) }} and {{ hisd(Duin) }} would-be savior both would have drowned had another swimmer not been nearby. A few others were also hauled out, but {{Balamung}}'s trap took more than a dozen.
A splashing downstream made {{Gerin}} whirl. Matter-of-fact as a river godlet, {{Drago}} the Bear came out of the water, wringing {{ hisd(Drago) }} long {{ beard(Drago) }} like a peasant wench with her man's breeches. Incredibly, armor still gleamed on {{ hisd(Drago) }} chest.
If anyone could survive such a dip, thought {{Gerin}}, it would be {{Drago}}. {{ He(Drago) }} was strong as an ox and lacked the imagination to let anything frighten {{ him(Drago) }}. "Nasty," {{ he(Drago) }} rumbled in a voice like falling trees. {{ He(Drago) }} might have been talking about the weather.
"Aye," an abstracted {{Gerin}} muttered. At the instant the bridge had melted away, the rain stopped. Pale, dim Nothos, nearing full, gleamed in a suddenly star-flecked sky, while ruddy Elleb, now waning toward third quarter, was just beginning to wester. The other two moons, golden Math and quick-moving Tiwaz, were both near new and hence invisible.
Hustling along a doubled handful of disheveled prisoners, most of them wounded, the weary army trudged back to the keep. {{Gerin}}'s serfs met them at the village. They shouted thanks for having their crops, or most of them, saved. Their dialect was so rustic that even {{Gerin}}, who had heard it since birth, found it hard to follow.
{{Gerin}} ordered ten oxen slaughtered, laying the fat-wrapped thighbones on the altars of {{Dyaus}} and the war-{{ god(Deinos) }} {{Deinos}} which stood in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} great hall. The rest of the meat vanished into {{ hisd(Gerin) }} vassals. To wash it down, barrel after barrel of smooth, foaming ale and sweet mead was broached and emptied. {{ Men(vassals) }} who found combat raising a different urge pursued peasant wenches and servant wenches, many of whom preferred being chased to chaste.
At first the {{ baron(Gerin) }} did not join the merrymaking. {{ He(Gerin) }} applied an ointment of honey, lard, and astringent herbs to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} wound (luckily not deep), and winced at its bite. Then {{ he(Gerin) }} had the brightest-looking captive, a tall mournful blond barbarian who kept {{ hisd(Cliath ) }} left hand clutched to a torn right shoulder, bandaged and brought into a storeroom. While two troopers stood by with drawn swords, {{Gerin}} cleaned {{ hisd(Gerin) }} nails with a dagger from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} belt. {{ He(Gerin) }} said nothing.
The silence bothered the Trokmê, who fidgeted. "What is it you want of me?" {{ he(Cliath) }} burst out at last. "It's Cliath {{ son(Cliath) }} of Ailech I am, of a house noble for more generations than I have toes and fingers, and no right at all do you have to treat me like some low footpad."
"What right have you," {{Gerin}} asked mildly, "to rob and burn my land and kill my people? I could flay the hide off your carcass in inch-wide strips and give it to my dogs to eat while what was left of you watched, and no one could say I did not have the right. Thank your gods {{Wolfar}} did not catch you; {{ he(Wolfar) }} would do it. But tell me what I need to know, and I will set you free. Otherwise"—his eyes flicked to the two hard soldiers by {{ him(Gerin) }}—"I'll walk out this door, and ask no questions after."
One of Cliath's eyes was swollen shut. The other peered at the Fox. "What would keep you from doing that anyway, once I've talked?"
{{Gerin}} shrugged. "I've held this keep almost eight years. People on both side of the Niffet know what my word is worth. And on this you have that word: you'll get no second chance."
Cliath studied {{ him(Gerin) }}. The Trokmê made as if to rub {{ hisd(Cliath) }} chin, but grimaced in pain and stopped. {{ He(Cliath) }} sighed. "What would you know of me, then?"
"Tell me this: what do you know of the black-robed {{ warlock(Balamung) }} who calls {{ himself(Balamung) }} {{Balamung}}?"
"Och, that kern? Till this raid it's little I've had to do with {{ him(Balamung) }}, and wanted less. It's bad cess for any {{ man(Cliath) }} to have truck with a {{ wizard(Balamung) }}, say I, for all {{ he(Balamung) }} brings loot. No glory in beating ensorceled foes is there, no more than in cutting the throat of a pig, and it tied, too. But those who go with {{Balamung}} grow fat, and the few as stand against {{ him(Balamung) }} die, and in ways less pretty than having the skins of them flayed off. I mind me of one {{ fellow(barbarian1) }}—puir wight!—who no slower than a sneeze was naught but a pile of twisty, slimy worms—and the stench of {{ him(barbarian1) }}!
"Nigh on a year and a half it is since the {{ wizard(Balamung) }} omadhaun came to us, and for all we're friends now with Bricriu's clan and thieving Meriasek's, still I long for the days when a warrior could take a head without asking the leave of a dried-up little turd like {{Balamung}}. {{ Him(Balamung) }} and {{ hisd(Balamung) }} dog-futtering talisman!" The Trokmê spat on the hard-packed dirt floor.
"Talisman?" {{Gerin}} prompted.
"Aye. With my own eyes I've seen it. 'Tis squarish, perhaps as long as my forearm, and as wide, but not near so thick, you understand, and opening out to double that. And when {{ he(Balamung) }}'d fain bewitch someone or magic up something, why, the talisman lights up almost like a torch. With my own eyes I've seen it," Cliath repeated.
"Can you read?" the {{ baron(Gerin) }} asked.
"No, nor write, no more than I can fly. Why in the name of the gods would you care to know that?"
"Never mind," {{Gerin}} said. "I know enough now." More than I want, {{ he(Gerin) }} added to {{ himself(Gerin) }}: Bricriu's clan and Meriasek's had been at feud since the days of their grand{{ father(Duren) }}s.
The Fox tossed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} little knife to the barbarian, who tucked it into the top of one of {{ hisd(Cliath) }} high rawhide boots. {{Gerin}} led {{ him(Cliath) }} through the main hall, ignoring {{ hisd(Gerin) }} vassals' stares. {{ He(Gerin) }} told {{ hisd(Gerin) }} startled gatekeepers to let Cliath out, and said to {{ him(Cliath) }}, "How you cross the river is your affair, but with that blade perhaps you won't be waylaid by my serfs."
Good eye shining, Cliath held out {{ hisd(Cliath) }} left hand. "A puir clasp, but I'm proud to make it. Och, what a clansmate you'd have been."
{{Gerin}} took the offered hand but shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. "No, I'd sooner live on my own land than take away my neighbor's. Now go, before I think about the trouble I'm giving myself by turning you loose."
As the northerner trotted down the low hill, {{Gerin}} was already on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} way back to the rollicking great hall, a frown on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} face. Truly {{Deinos}} was coursing {{ hisd(Deinos) }} terrible warhounds through the northern forests, and the {{ baron(Gerin) }} was the game they sought.
After {{ he(Gerin) }} had downed five or six tankards, though, things looked rosier. {{ He(Gerin) }} staggered up the stairs to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} room, arm round the waist of a serving {{ wench(lover1) }}. But even as {{ he(Gerin) }} held {{ herd(lover1) }} lovely hips later, part of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind saw Castle Fox a smoking ruin, and fire and death all along the border.
<h2>II</h2>
{{ He(Gerin) }} woke some time past noon. By the racket coming from below, the roistering had never ceased. Probably no one was on the walls, either, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought disgustedly; could {{Balamung}} have roused {{ hisd(Balamung) }} {{ men(vassals) }} to a second attack, {{ he(Balamung) }} would have had Fox Keep in the palm of {{ hisd(Balamung) }} hand.
The {{ girl(lover1) }} was already gone. {{Gerin}} dressed and went down to the great hall, looking for half a dozen of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} leading vassals. {{ He(Gerin) }} found {{Van}} and {{Rollan}} the Boar-Slayer still rehashing the battle, drawing lines on the table in sticky mead. {{Fandor}} the Fat had a beaker of mead, too, but {{ he(Fandor) }} was drinking from it. That was {{ hisd(Fandor) }} usual sport; {{ hisd(Fandor) }} red nose and awesome capacity testified to it. {{Drago}} was asleep on the floor, {{ hisd(Drago) }} body swathed in furs. Beside {{ him(Drago) }} snored {{Simrin}} Widin's {{ son(Rollan) }}. {{Duin}} was nowhere to be found.
The Fox woke {{Simrin}} and {{Drago}} and bullied {{ hisd(Gerin) }} lieutenants up the stairs to the library. Grumbling, they found seats round the central table. They stared suspiciously at the shelves full of neatly pigeonholed scrolls and codices bound in leather and gold leaf. Most of them were as illiterate as {{Cliath}} and held reading an affectation, but {{Gerin}} was a good enough {{ man(Gerin) }} of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hands to let them overlook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eccentricity. Still, the books and the quiet overawed them a bit. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} would need that today.
{{ He(Gerin) }} scratched {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ beard(Gerin) }} and remembered how horrified everyone had been when, after {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ father(Duren) }} was killed, {{ he(Gerin) }}'d come back from the southlands {{ clean-shaven(Gerin) }}. {{Duin}}'s {{ father(Borbeto) }}, dour old {{Borbeto}} the Grim, had managed the barony till {{ hisd(Gerin) }} return. When {{ he(Borbeto) }} saw {{Gerin}}, {{ he(Borbeto) }}'d roared, "Is {{Duren}}'s {{ son(Gerin) }} a fancy-{{ boy(Gerin) }}?" {{Gerin}} had only grinned and answered, "Ask your {{ daughter(lover1) }}"; shouts of laughter won {{ hisd(Gerin) }} vassals to {{ him(Gerin) }}.
{{Duin}} wandered in, still fumbling at {{ hisd(Duin) }} breeches. Bawdy chuckles greeted {{ him(Duin) }}. {{Fandor}} called, "Easier to stay on a {{ lass(lover2) }} than a horse, is it?"
"It is, and more fun besides," {{Duin}} grinned, plainly none the worse for {{ hisd(Duin) }} dunking. {{ He(Duin) }} turned to {{Gerin}}, sketched a salute. "What's on your mind, {{ lord(Gerin) }}?"
"Among other things," {{Gerin}} said drily, "the bridge that was almost your end."
"Downright uncanny, I call it," {{Rollan}} murmured. {{ He(Rollan) }} spoke thickly, for {{ hisd(Rollan) }} slashed lip had three stitches holding it shut. Tall, solid, and dark, {{ he(Rollan) }} ran {{ hisd(Rollan) }} fief with some skill, fought bravely, and never let a new thought trouble {{ hisd(Rollan) }} mind.
"Me, I have no truck with wizards," {{Drago}} said righteously. {{ He(Drago) }} sneezed. "Damn! I've taken cold." {{ He(Drago) }} went on, "There's no way to trust a body like that. Noses always in a scroll, think they're better than simple folk."
"Remember where you are, fool," {{Simrin}} Widin's {{ son(Rollan) }} hissed.
"No offense meant, of course, {{ lord(Gerin) }}," {{Drago}} said hastily.
"Of course." {{Gerin}} sighed. "Now let me tell you what I learned last night." The faces of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} people grew grave as the tale unfolded, and there was a silence when {{ he(Gerin) }} was through.
{{Duin}} broke it. Along with {{ hisd(Duin) }} auburn hair, {{ hisd(Duin) }} fiery temper told of Trokmê blood. Now {{ he(Duin) }} thumped a fist down on the table and shouted, "A pox on wizardry! There's but one thing to do about it. We have to hit the whorespawn before {{ he(Balamung) }} can hit us again, this time with all the northerners, not just {{Aingus}}' clan."
A mutter of agreement ran down the table. {{Gerin}} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. This was what {{ he(Gerin) }} had to head off at all costs. "There's nothing I'd like better," {{ he(Gerin) }} lied, "but it won't do. On {{ hisd(Gerin) }} home ground, their {{ wizard(Balamung) }} would squash us like so many bugs. But from what the braggart said, we have some time. What I'd fain do is go south to the capital and hire a mage from the Sorcerers' Collegium there so we can fight magic with magic. I don't relish leaving Fox Keep under the axe, but the task is mine, for I still have connections in the southlands. We can settle {{Balamung}} properly once I'm back."
"It strikes me as a fool's errand, {{ lord(Gerin) }}," {{Duin}} said, plain-spoken as always. "What we need is a good, hard stroke now—"
"{{Duin}}, if you want to {{ beard(Duin) }} that {{ wizard(Balamung) }} without one at your back, then you're the fool. If you had to take a keep with a stone-thrower over its gate, you'd find a stone-thrower of your own, wouldn't you?"
"I suppose so," {{Duin}} said. {{ Hisd(Duin) }} tone was surly, but there were nods round the table. {{Gerin}} was relieved. {{ He(Gerin) }} was coming to the tricky part. With a little luck, {{ he(Gerin) }} could slip it by them before they noticed.
"Stout {{ fellow(Duin) }}!" {{ he(Gerin) }} said, and went on easily, "{{Van}} will need your help here while I'm gone. With {{ him(Van) }} in charge, nothing can go too badly wrong."
It didn't work. Even {{Fandor}} and {{Simrin}}, both of whom had kept those noses buried in their drinking jacks till now, jerked up their heads. Diffidently, {{Rollan}} began, "Begging your pardon, my {{ lord(Gerin) }}—" and {{Gerin}} braced for insubordination. It came fast enough: "The gods know {{Van}} of the Strong Arm has proven {{ himself(Van) }} a {{ man(Van) }}, time and again, and a loyal and true vassal as well. But for all that, {{ he(Van) }} is an outlander and owns no land hereabouts, guesting with you as {{ he(Van) }} does. It'd be downright unseemly for us, whose families have held our fiefs for generations, to take orders from {{ him(Van) }}."
{{Gerin}} gathered {{ himself(Gerin) }} for an explosion. Before {{ he(Gerin) }} loosed it, {{ he(Gerin) }} saw all the landed nodding their agreement. {{ He(Gerin) }} caught {{Van}}'s eyes; the outlander shrugged. Tasting gall, the Fox yielded with as much grace as {{ he(Gerin) }} could. "If that's how you would have it, so be it. {{Van}}, would it please you to ride with me, then?"
"It would that, captain," {{Van}} said, coming as close as {{ he(Van) }} ever did to {{Gerin}}'s proper feudal title. "I've never been south of the Kirs, and I've heard enough about Elabon's capital to make me want to see it."
"Fine," {{Gerin}} said. "{{Duin}}, you have the highest standing of any here. Do you think you can keep things afloat while I'm away?"
"Aye, or die trying."
{{Gerin}} feared the latter, but merely said, "Good!" and whispered a prayer under {{ hisd(Gerin) }} breath. {{Duin}} was more than doughty enough and not stupid, but {{ he(Duin) }} lacked common sense.
{{Drago}} and {{Rollan}} decided to stay at Fox Keep themselves and leave the defense of their own castles to the vassal contingents they would send home; {{Gerin}} dared hope they might restrain {{Duin}}. After {{ hisd(Gerin) }} other {{ men(vassals) }} had gone, {{ he(Gerin) }} spent a couple of hours giving {{Duin}} instructions on matters probable, matters possible, and as many matters impossible as {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fertile mind could envision. {{ He(Gerin) }} finished, "For {{Dyaus}}' sake, send word along the West March Road and the {{Emperor}}'s Highway. The border barons must know of this, so they can ready themselves for the storm."
"Even {{Wolfar}}?"
"As {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} holding borders mine, news has to go through {{ him(Wolfar) }} anyway. But the slug happens to be out a-courting, and {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} {{ man(Schild) }} {{Schild}}, though {{ he(Schild) }} has no love for me, won't kill a messenger for the sport of it. Also, you could do worse than to get {{Siglorel}} here; {{ he(Siglorel) }} has the most power of any Elabonian {{ wizard(Siglorel) }} north of the Kirs, even if {{ he(Siglorel) }} is overfond of ale. Last I heard, {{ he(Siglorel) }} was in the keep of {{Hovan}} {{ son(Hovan) }} of Hagop east of here, trying to cure Hovan's piles."
{{Duin}} nodded, hopefully in wisdom. {{ He(Duin) }} surprised {{Gerin}} by offering a suggestion of {{ hisd(Duin) }} own: "If you're bound to go through with this mage scheme, {{ lord(Gerin) }}, why not go to Ikos and ask the {{Sibyl}} for {{ herd(Sibyl) }} advice?"
"You know, that's not a bad thought," {{Gerin}} mused. "I've been that way once before, and it will only cost me an extra day or so."
* * *
Next day {{ he(Gerin) }} decided—not for the first time—that mixing ale and mead was a poor idea. The cool, crisp early morning air settled in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} lungs like sludge. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} side was stiff and sore. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} head ached. The creaks and groans of the light wagon and steady pound of hooves on stone roadbed, sounds {{ he(Gerin) }} usually failed to notice, rang loud in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ears. The sun seemed to have singled {{ him(Gerin) }} out for all its rays.
Worst of all, {{Van}} was awake and in full song. Holding {{ hisd(Gerin) }} throbbing head, {{Gerin}} asked, "Don't you know any quiet tunes?"
"Aye, several of 'em," {{Van}} answered, and returned to {{ hisd(Van) }} interrupted ditty.
{{Gerin}} contemplated death and other delights. At last the song came to an end. "I thank you," {{ he(Van) }} said.
"Nothing at all, captain." {{Van}} frowned, then went on, "I think yesterday I was too hellishly worn out to pay as much attention to what you were saying as I should. Why is it such a fell thing for {{Balamung}} to have got {{ hisd(Balamung) }} claws on Shabeth-Shiri's book?"
The Fox was glad to talk, if only to dull the edge of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own worry. "Shabeth-Shiri was the greatest {{ sorcerer(Shabeth-Shiri) }} of Kizzuwatna long ago: the land where all wizardry began, and where it flourishes to this day. They say {{ he(Shabeth-Shiri) }} was the first to uncover the laws behind their magic, and set them down in writing to teach {{ hisd(Shabeth-Shiri) }} pupils."
"Now, that can't be the book {{Balamung}} was boasting of, can it?"
"No. I have a copy of that one myself, as a matter of fact. So does everyone who's ever dabbled in magic. It's not a book of spells, but of the principles by which they're cast. But, using those principles, Shabeth-Shiri worked more powerful warlockery than any this poor shuddering world has seen since. {{ He(Shabeth-Shiri) }} made {{ himself(Shabeth-Shiri) }} {{ king(Shabeth-Shiri) }} as well as mage, and {{ he(Shabeth-Shiri) }} fought so many wars {{ he(Shabeth-Shiri) }} ran short of followers, or so the story goes. So {{ he(Shabeth-Shiri) }} kept {{ hisd(Shabeth-Shiri) }} rule alive by raising demons to fight for {{ him(Shabeth-Shiri) }}, and by many other such cantrips. Think how embarrassed an army that thought itself safe behind a stream would be to have it flood and drown their camp, or turn to blood—or to see Shabeth-Shiri's warriors charging over a bridge like the one {{Balamung}} used against us."
"Embarrassed is scarcely the word, captain."
"I suppose not. Shabeth-Shiri wrote down all {{ hisd(Shabeth-Shiri) }} most frightful spells, too, but in a book {{ he(Shabeth-Shiri) }} showed to no one. {{ He(Shabeth-Shiri) }} meant it for {{ hisd(Shabeth-Shiri) }} {{ son(Shabeth-Shiri) }}, they say, but for all {{ hisd(Shabeth-Shiri) }} wizardry {{ he(Shabeth-Shiri) }} was beaten at last: all the other mages and marshals of Kizzuwatna combined against {{ him(Shabeth-Shiri) }}, lest {{ he(Shabeth-Shiri) }} rule the whole world. {{ Hisd(Shabeth-Shiri) }} {{ son(Shabeth-Shiri) }} was killed in the sack of {{ hisd(Shabeth-Shiri) }} last citadel, Shaushka—"
"Shaushka the Damned? That was {{ his(Shabeth-Shiri) }}? I've seen it with my own eyes. It lies in the far north of Kizzuwatna, at the edge of the plains of Shanda, and the plainsmen showed it to me from far away: stark, dark, and dead. Nothing grows there to this day, even after—how many years?"
{{Gerin}} shuddered. "Two thousand, if a day. But the winners never found Shabeth-Shiri's body, or {{ hisd(Shabeth-Shiri) }} book either, and sorcerers have searched for it from that day to this. The legends say some of its pages are of human skin. It glows with a light of its own when its master uses it." The {{ baron(Gerin) }} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. "{{Cliath}} saw it, sure as sure."
"A nice {{ fellow(Shabeth-Shiri) }}, this Shabeth-Shiri, and I think {{ he(Shabeth-Shiri) }}'d be proud of the one who has {{ hisd(Shabeth-Shiri) }} Book now. It seems all Kizzuwatnans have a taste for blood, though," Van said. "Once when I was traveling with the nomads—" {{Gerin}} never found out about the Kizzuwatnan Van had fallen foul of, for at that moment two hurtling bodies burst from the oaks that grew almost to within bowshot of the road.
One was a stag, proud head now low as it fled. But it had not taken more than three bounds when a tawny avalanche struck it from behind and smashed it to the grass. Great stabbing fangs tore into its throat, once, twice. Blood spurted and slowed; the stag's hooves drummed and were still.
Crouched over its kill, the longtooth snarled a warning at the travelers. It settled its short hind legs under its belly and began to feed. Its stumpy tail quivered in absurd delight as it tore hunks of flesh from the stag's carcass. When the travellers stopped to watch, it growled deep in its throat and dragged its prey into the cover of the woods.
Van was all for flushing it out again, but {{Gerin}} demurred; like rogue aurochs, longtooths were best hunted by parties larger than two. Rather grumpily, Van put away {{ hisd(Dan) }} spear. "Sometimes, {{Gerin}}," {{ he(Van) }} said, "you take all the fun out of life."
The Fox did not answer. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} gloomy mood slowly cleared as the sun rose higher in the sky. {{ He(Gerin) }} looked about with more than a little pride, for the lands {{ he(Gerin) }} ruled were rich ones. And, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought, the wealth they made stayed on them.
The lands between the Kirs and the Niffet had drawn the Empire of Elabon for their copper and tin and as a buffer between its heartland and the northern savages. Once seized, though, they were left largely to their own devices.
Not a measure of grain nor a pound of tin did Elabon take from {{Gerin}}'s land, or from any other borderer landholder. The Marchwarden of the North, {{Carus}} Beo's {{ son(Carus) }}, kept {{ hisd(Carus) }} toy garrison in Cassat under the shadow of the Kirs. So long as the borderers held the Trokmoi at bay, the Empire let them have their freedom.
Traffic on the great road was light so near the Niffet. The only traveler {{Gerin}} and Van met the first day was a wandering merchant. A thin, doleful {{ man(merchant) }}, {{ he(merchant) }} nodded gravely as {{ he(merchant) }} headed north. A calico cat with mismatched eyes and only one ear sat on {{ hisd(merchant) }} shoulder. It glared at {{Gerin}} as they passed.
When night began to near, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} brought a brace of fowls from a farmer who dwelt by the road. Van shook {{ hisd(Van) }} head as {{ he(Van) }} watched {{ hisd(Van) }} friend haggle with the peasant. "Why not just take what you need, like any noble?" {{ he(Van) }} asked. "The kern is your subject, after all."
"True, but not my slave. A {{ baron(Gerin) }} who treats {{ hisd(Gerin) }} serfs like beasts of burden will see {{ hisd(Gerin) }} castle come down round {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ears the first time {{ hisd(Gerin) }} crops fail. Serve {{ him(Gerin) }} right, too, the fool."
After they stopped for the evening, {{Gerin}} wrung a hen's neck and drained its blood into a trough {{ he(Gerin) }} dug in the rich black soil. "That should satisfy any roving spirits," {{ he(Gerin) }} said, plucking and gutting the bird and skewering it to roast over the campfire.
"Any that wouldn't sooner drink our blood instead," Van said. "Captain, out on the plains of Shanda the ghosts have real fangs, and they aren't shy of watchfires. Only the charms the nomads' shamans magic up can keep them at bay—and sometimes not those, either, if most of the moons are dark. A bad place."
{{Gerin}} believed {{ him(Van) }}. Any land that made {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hard-bitten comrade leery sounded like a good place to avoid.
They drew straws for the first watch. Within seconds, Van was curled in {{ hisd(Vanon) }} bedroll and snoring like a thunderstorm. {{Gerin}} watched Tiwaz and Math, both thin crescents almost lost in the skirts of twilight, follow the sun down to the horizon. As they sank, full {{Nothos}} rose. Under {{ hisd(Nothos) }} weak grayish light, field and forest alike were half-seen mysteries. Small night-creatures chirped and hummed. {{Gerin}} let the fire die into embers, and the ghosts came.
As always, the eye refused to grasp their shapes, sliding away before they could be recognized. They swarmed round the pool of blood like great carrion flies. Their buzzing filled {{Gerin}}'s mind. Some shouted in tongues so ancient their very names were lost. Others {{ he(Gerin) }} almost understood, but no true words could be heard, only clamor and loss and wailing.
The Fox knew that if {{ he(Gerin) }} tried to grasp one of the flittering shapes it would slip through {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fingers like so much mist, for the dead kept but a pallid semblance of life. Grateful for the boon of blood, they tried to give {{ him(Gerin) }} such redes as they thought good, but only a noise like the rushing wind filled {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. Had {{ he(Gerin) }} not granted them that gift, or had the fire not been there, they likely would have driven {{ him(Gerin) }} mad.
{{ He(Gerin) }} kept watch until midnight, staring at stars and full {{Nothos}} and the half-seen shapes of spirits until Elleb, a copper disc almost half chewed away, was well clear of the dark woods on the horizon. No human disturbed {{ him(Gerin) }}: few travelers were so bold as to risk moving in the dark of the sun.
When {{Gerin}} roused Van, {{ he(Van) }} woke with the instant awareness of a seasoned warrior. "The ghosts are bad tonight," the {{ baron(Gerin) }} mumbled, and then {{ he(Gerin) }} was asleep.
Van announced the dawn with a whoop that jerked the Fox awake. Trying to pry {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eyes open, {{ he(Gerin) }} said, "I feel as if my head were filled with sand. 'Early in the morning' says the same thing twice."
"An hour this side of midday is counted as morning, is it not?"
"Aye, it is, and too bloody early in the bargain. Oh for the days when I was in the capital and not one of the sages I listened to thought of opening their mouthes before noon."
{{Gerin}} gnawed leathery journeybread, dried fruit, and smoked sausage, washing them down with bitter beer. {{ He(Gerin) }} had to choke the bread down. The stuff had the virtue of keeping nearly forever, and {{ he(Gerin) }} understood why: the bugs liked it no better than {{ he(Gerin) }}.
{{ He(Gerin) }} sighed, stretched, and climbed into {{ hisd(Gerin) }} armor, wincing as {{ hisd(Gerin) }} helm slipped down over one ear bent permanently outward by a northerner's club in a long-ago skirmish. "The birds are shining, the sun is chirping, and who am I to complain?" {{ he(Gerin) }} said.
Van gave {{ him(Gerin) }} a curious glance. "You feeling all right, captain?" {{ he(Van) }} asked, a note of real concern in {{ hisd(Van) }} voice.
"Yes and no," {{Gerin}} said thoughtfully. "But for the first time since I came back from the southlands, it doesn't matter at all. Things are out of my hands, and they will be for a while now. If someone pisses in the soup-pot, why, {{Duin}} will just have to try and take care of it without me. It's a funny feeling, you know. I'm half glad to be free and half afraid things will fall apart without me. It's like running a long way and then stopping short: I've got used to the strain, and feel wrong without it."
They moved south steadily, but not in silence. Van extracted a clay flute from {{ hisd(Van) }} kit and made the morning hideous with it. {{Gerin}} politely asked if {{ he(Van) }}'d been taking music lessons from the ghosts, but {{ he(Van) }} shrugged a massive shrug and kept on tweedling.
A pair of guardhouses flanked the road where it crossed from {{Gerin}}'s lands to those of Palin the Eagle. Two sets of troopers sprawled in the roadway, dicing the day away. At the creak of the wagon, they abandoned the game and reached for their weapons.
{{Gerin}} looked down {{ hisd(Gerin) }} long nose at the wary archers. "Hail!" {{ he(Gerin) }} said. "Would that you'd been so watchful last summer, when you let {{Wacho}} and {{ hisd(Wacho) }} brigands sneak south without so much as a challenge."
The guard captain shuffled {{ hisd(retainer1) }} feet. "{{ Lord(Gerin) }}, how was I to know {{ he(Wacho) }}'d forged {{ hisd(Wacho) }} safe-conduct?"
"By the hand of it, and the spelling. The lout could barely write. Too late now, but if it happens again you'll find a new {{ lord(Gerin) }}, probably in the underworld. Do we pass your inspection?"
"You do that, {{ lord(Gerin) }}." The guard waved the wagon on. {{Gerin}} drew sword as {{ he(Gerin) }} passed the ancient boundary stone separating {{ hisd(Gerin) }} holding from {{Palin}}'s. {{Palin}}'s guards returned {{ hisd(Gerin) }} salute. For long generations the two houses had been at peace. The stone, its timeworn runes covered by gray-green moss, had sunk almost half its height into the soft earth.
Once past the guards, Van turned and said to {{Gerin}}, "You know, Fox, when I first came to your land I thought {{Palin}} the Eagle had to be some fine warrior, to judge by what {{ hisd(Palin) }} folk called {{ him(Palin) }}. How was I to know they were talking of {{ hisd(Palin) }} nose?"
"{{ He(Palin) }}'s no Carlun come again, I will say." {{Gerin}} chuckled. "But {{ he(Palin) }} and {{ hisd(Palin) }} vassals keep order well enough that I don't fear a night or so in the open in {{ hisd(Palin) }} lands, or perhaps with one of {{ hisd(Palin) }} {{ lord(vassals) }}lets."
"You don't want {{ himself(Palin) }} to guest you?"
"No indeed. {{ He(Palin) }} has an unmarried {{ sister-opp(Gerin) }} who must be rising forty by now and desperate, poor thing. Worse, {{ she-opp(Gerin) }} cooks for {{ him(Palin) }} too, and badly. The last time I ate with {{Palin}}, I thought the belly-sickness had me, not just a sour stomach."
When the travelers did stop for the night, it was at the ramshackle keep of one of {{Palin}}'s vassals, {{Raff}} the Ready. A blocky boulder of a {{ man(Raff) }}, {{ he(Raff) }} was very much of the old school, wearing a forked {{ beard(Raff) }} that almost reached {{ hisd(Raff) }} waist. {{ Hisd(Raff) }} unflappable solidity reminded the Fox of {{Drago}}; so, less hearteningly, did {{ hisd(Raff) }} disdain for cleanliness.
Withal, {{ he(Raff) }} set a good table. {{ He(Raff) }} had killed a cow that day, and along with the beef there was a stew of frogs and mussels from a nearby pond, fresh-baked bread, blueberries and blueberry tarts, and a fine, nutlike ale with which to wash them down.
{{Gerin}} sighed in contentment, loosened {{ hisd(Gerin) }} belt, belched, and then, reluctantly, gave Raff {{ hisd(Gerin) }} news. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} {{ hostm(Raff) }} looked uneasy. {{ He(Raff) }} promised to spread the word. "You think your soldiers won't be able to hold them at the Niffet, then?" {{ he(Raff) }} asked.
"I'm very much afraid they won't."
"Well, I'll tell my neighbors, not that it'll do much good. All of us are looking south, not north, waiting for the trouble in {{Bevon}}'s barony to spill over into ours."
"There's fighting there?" Van asked hopefully.
"Aye, there is that. All four of {{Bevon}}'s children are brawling over the succession, and {{ him(Bevon) }} not even dead yet. One of them ran twenty sheep off {{Palin}}'s land, too, the {{ bastard(Bevon) }}."
With that warning, they left early, almost before dawn. They carried a torch to keep the ghosts at bay. Even so, {{Gerin}}'s skin crawled with dread until the spirits fled the rays of the sun.
{{ He(Gerin) }} spent a nervous morning hurrying south through {{Bevon}}'s strife-torn barony. Every one of Bevon's vassals kept their castles shut tight. The retainers on the walls gave {{Gerin}} and Van hard stares, but no one tried to stop them.
Around noon, they heard fighting down an approaching side road. Van looked interested, but {{Gerin}} cared far more about reaching the capital than getting drawn into an imbroglio not {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own.
The choice did not stay in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hands. Two spearcarriers and an archer, plainly fleeing, burst onto the highway. The archer took one quick glance at {{Gerin}} and Van, shouted "More traitors!" and let fly. {{Hisd(barbarian1) }} shaft sailed between them, perhaps because {{ he(barbarian1) }}could not pick either one as target.
{{ He(barbarian1) }} got no second shot. {{Gerin}} had been sitting with bow ready to hand, and no confusion spoiled {{ hisd(Gerin) }} aim. But even as the archer fell, {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} comrades charged the wagon. {{Gerin}} and Van sprang down to meet them.
The fight was short but savage. The footsoldiers seemed to have already despaired of their lives, and thought only of killing before they fell. Cool as usual in a fight, the Fox ducked under {{ hisd(Gerin) }} foe's guard and slid the point of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} blade between the luckless {{ fellow(barbarian1) }}'s ribs. The {{ man(barbarian1) }} coughed blood and died.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} wheeled to help Van, but {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend needed no aid. A stroke of {{ hisd(Van) }} axe had shattered the {{ man(barbarian1) }}'s spearshaft, another clove through helm and skull alike. Only a tiny cut above {{ hisd(Van) }} knee showed {{ he(Van) }} had fought at all. {{ He(Van) }} rubbed at it, grumbling, "{{ Bastard(barbarian1) }} pinked me. I must be getting old."
The triumph left the taste of ashes in {{Gerin}}'s mouth. What fools the people of Elabon were, to be fighting among themselves while a storm to sweep them all away was rising in the northern forests! And now {{ he(Gerin) }} was as guilty as any. Warriors who might have been bold against the Trokmoi were stiffening corpses in the roadway—because of {{ him(Gerin) }}.
"Where you're going makes you more important than them," Van said when {{ he(Gerin) }} voiced that worry aloud.
"I hope so." But in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} heart, {{Gerin}} wondered if the southern wizards could withstand {{Balamung}} and the Book of {{Shabeth-Shiri}}.
{{ He(Gerin) }} sighed with relief when at last {{ he(Gerin) }} spied the guardhouse of Bevon's southern neighbor, {{Ricolf}} the Red. {{ He(Gerin) }} was not surprised to see it had a double complement of warriors.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} returned the greetings {{Ricolf}}'s guards gave {{ him(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} knew a few of them, for {{ he(Gerin) }} had spent several pleasant weeks at {{Ricolf}}'s keep on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} last journey to the southlands. "It's been too long, {{ lord(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}," one of the guards said. "{{Ricolf}} will be glad to see you."
"And I {{ him(Ricolf) }}. {{ He(Ricolf) }} was like a second {{ father(Ricolf) }} to me."
"Peace be with you, wayfarers," {{Ricolf}}'s {{ man(retainer1) }} called as they drove past.
"And to you also peace." Van made the proper response, for {{ he(Van) }} held the reins. {{ He(Van) }} had been quick to pick up the customs of {{Gerin}}'s land.
The sun was dying in the west and {{Gerin}} felt the first low keenings of long-dead wraiths when {{Ricolf}}'s castle came into view, crowned by a scarlet banner. Somewhere high overhead, an eagle screamed. Van's sharp eyes searched the sky till {{ he(Van) }} found the moving speck. "On our right," {{ he(Van) }} said. "There's a good omen, if you care for one."
"I mislike taking omens from birds," {{Gerin}} said. "They're too public. Who's to say a foretelling is meant for {{ him(Gerin) }} and not some lout in the next holding who has to squint to see it?"
A {{ boy(retainer2) }}'s clear voice floated from {{Ricolf}}'s watchtower: "Who comes to the holding of {{Ricolf}} the Red?"
"I am {{Gerin}}, called the Fox, guest-friend to your {{ master(Ricolf) }} {{Ricolf}}, and with me is my friend and companion, Van of the Strong Arm. By {{Dyaus}} and {{Rilyn}}, {{ god(Rilyn) }} of friendship, we claim shelter for the night."
"Bide a moment." After a pause, {{Gerin}} heard {{Ricolf}}'s deep voice exclaim, "What? Let them in, fool, let them in!" The drawbridge swung down. The {{ lad(retainer2) }} cried, "In the names of {{Dyaus}} and Rilyn, welcome, guest-friend {{Gerin}}! Be you welcome also, Van of the Strong Arm."
{{Ricolf}}'s keep, more sophisticated than {{Gerin}}'s frontier fortress, had stone outwalls instead of a log palisade. Its moat was broad and deep; limp-looking plants splashed the slick surface of the water. A vile stench rose from the moat. Sinuous ripples made {{Gerin}} suspect water plants were not the only things to call it home.
{{Ricolf}} greeted {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} guests at the gatehouse. {{ He(Ricolf) }} was stout, perhaps fifty, with a square, ruddy face and blue eyes. {{ Hisd(Ricolf) }} tunic and {{ trousers(Ricolf) }} were brightly checked and modish in cut, but the sword swinging at {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} belt was a plain, well-battered weapon that had seen much use. {{ He(Ricolf) }} had more gray in {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} red hair and {{ beard(Ricolf) }} than {{Gerin}} remembered, and lines of worry the Fox had not seen before bracketed {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} eyes and mouth.
When {{Gerin}} scrambled down from the wagon, {{Ricolf}} enfolded {{ him(Gerin) }} in a bearhug, pumping {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hand and thumping {{ hisd(Gerin) }} back. "Great {{Dyaus}} above, {{ lad(Gerin) }}, is it ten years? They've made a {{ man(Gerin) }} of you! Ten years indeed, and us not living five days' ride from each other. This must never happen again!"
Untangling {{ himself(Gerin) }}, {{Gerin}} said, "True enough, but I doubt if either one of us had a five-day stretch free and clear in all those years." {{ He(Gerin) }} explained why {{ he(Gerin) }} was traveling south. {{Ricolf}} nodded in grim comprehension. {{Gerin}} went on, "If what traders say is true, you've had your own troubles."
"I did, until I sent my unloving cousin Sarus to the afterworld this past winter," {{Ricolf}} agreed. {{ He(Ricolf) }} focused on Van. "Is this your new lieutenant? I thought what news I heard of {{ him(Van) }} so much nonsense, but I see it was just the truth."
"My comrade, rather," {{Gerin}} said, and made the introduction. Van acknowledged it with grave respect. {{ Hisd(Van) }} broad hand, back thick-thatched with golden hair, swallowed {{Ricolf}}'s in its clasp.
"I greet you as well, Van of the Strong Arm. Use my home as you own for as long as you would. Speaking of which"—{{Ricolf}} turned back to {{Gerin}}—"would you like to scrub off the dust of the road in my bath-house before we eat? You have the time, I think."
"Bath-house?" {{Gerin}} stared. "I thought I'd have to shiver in the streams or reek like a dungheap till I got south of the mountains."
{{Ricolf}} looked pleased. "So far as I know, I have the first up here. I had it put in last summer, when I sent messages to the unmarried barons of the north-country—and to some south of the Kirs, too—that any who thought themselves worthy of my {{ daughter(Elise) }} {{Elise}}'s hand should come here, to let me decide which I thought most suited to {{ her(Elise) }}. My {{ wife-opp(Ricolf) }} Yrse gave me no {{ son-opp(Elise) }} who lived, you know, nor have I hopes for any legitimate ones now, as I've no real intention of marrying again. I had three bastards, and one a {{ boy-opp(Elise) }} of promise, too, but the chest-fever carried them off two winters back, poor ones, so when I die the holding passes to {{Elise}} and whomever {{ she(Elise) }} weds. {{Gerin}}, you must have got my invitation to join us; I know you're still unmarried."
"Yes, I did, but I had an arrow through my shoulder. It was a nasty one, and I was afraid the wound would rot if I traveled too soon. I sent my regrets."
"That's right, so you did. I remember now. I was truly sorry; you've done yourself a fine job since {{Duren}} and {{Dagref}}, er, died."
"It wasn't the trade I was trained for," {{Gerin}} shrugged. "My {{ father(Duren) }} always counted on {{Dagref}}; besides being older than me, {{ he(Duren) }} was a fighter born. Who would have thought the Trokmoi could get them both at once? I know my {{ father(Duren) }} never did. As for me, I'm still alive, so I suppose I haven't disgraced myself."
{{ He(Gerin) }} changed the subject; remembering {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ father(Duren) }} still hurt. "Now you'd better show me where that bath-house of yours is, before your dogs decide I'm part of the midden." {{ He(Gerin) }} scratched the ears of a shaggy, reddish hound sniffing {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ankles. Its tail switched back and forth as it grinned up at {{ him(Gerin) }}, tongue lolling out. A half-memory flickered, but {{ he(Gerin) }} could not make it light.
"Go away, Ruffian!" {{Ricolf}} snapped. The dog ignored {{ him(Ricolf) }}. "Beast thinks the place belongs to {{ him(Gerin) }}," {{Ricolf}} grumbled. {{ He(Ricolf) }} took {{Gerin}}'s arm and pointed. "Right over there, and I'll see to it your horses are tended."
{{Ricolf}}'s tubs were carved limestone. The delicate frieze of river godlets and nymphs carved round them told {{Gerin}} they'd been hauled up from the south, for local gravers were less skilled. Soaking in steaming water, the Fox said, "{{Ricolf}} gives the suitors nothing but the finest. I never thought I'd feel clean again."
Van's bulk almost oozed out of the tub, but {{ he(Van) }} grunted contented agreement. {{ He(Van) }} asked, "What is this {{ daughter(Elise) }} of {{Ricolf}}'s like?"
{{Gerin}} paused to rinse suds from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hair. "Your guess is as good as mine. Ten years back, {{ she(Elise) }} was small and skinny and rather wished {{ she(Elise) }} were a {{ boy-opp(Elise) }}."
They dried off. Van spent a few minutes polishing imaginary dull places on {{ hisd(Van) }} cuirass and combing the scarlet crest of {{ hisd(Van) }} helm. {{Gerin}} did not re-don {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own armor, choosing instead a sky-blue tunic and black breeches.
"With your gear, you could go anywhere," {{ he(Gerin) }} said, "but I'd look a mere private soldier in mine. Even this is none too good; the southerners will doubtless have their hair all curled and oiled and wear those toga things they affect." {{ He(Gerin) }} waved a limp-wristed hand. "And they talk so pretty, too."
"Don't have much use for them, eh, captain?"
{{Gerin}} smiled wryly. "That's the funniest part of it. I spent the happiest part of my life south of the Kirs. I'm a southerner at heart some ways, I suppose, but I can't let it show at Fox Keep."
{{Ricolf}} led them into {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} long hall. At the west end, a great pile of fat-wrapped bones smoked before {{Dyaus}}' altar. "You feed the {{ god(Dyaus) }} well," {{Gerin}} said.
"{{ He(Dyaus) }} has earned it." {{Ricolf}} turned to the {{ men(vassals) }} already at the tables. "Let me present the {{ baron(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}, called the Fox, and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} companion Van of the Strong Arm. Friends, we have here {{Rihwin}} the Fox—"
{{Gerin}} stared at the {{ man(Rihwin) }} who shared {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sobriquet. {{Rihwin}} stared back, {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} smooth face a mask. {{ Hisd(Rihwin) }} fresh cheeks alone would have said {{ he(Rihwin) }} was from the south, but {{ he(Rihwin) }} also wore a flowing green toga and a golden hoop in {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} left ear. {{Gerin}} liked most southern ways, but {{ he(Gerin) }} had always thought earrings excessive.
{{Ricolf}} was still talking. "Also Rumold of the Long Bow, Laidrad the Besieger, {{Wolfar}} of the Axe—"
{{Gerin}} muttered a polite unpleasantry. {{Wolfar}}, a dark-skinned lump of a {{ man(Wolfar) }} with bushy eyebrows, coarse black hair, and an unkempt thicket of {{ beard(Wolfar) }} that almost reached {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} swordbelt, was the Fox's western neighbor. They'd fought a bloody skirmish over nothing in particular two winters ago, before {{Wolfar}} went to seek {{Ricolf}}'s {{ daughter(Elise) }}.
While {{Ricolf}} droned on, introducing more suitors and retainers of {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} household, {{Gerin}} got hungrier and hungrier. Finally {{Ricolf}} said, "And last but surely not least, my {{ daughter(Elise) }} {{Elise}}."
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} was dimly aware of Van's sweeping off {{ hisd(Van) }} helmet and somehow bowing from the waist in full armor. What {{Elise}}'s long golden {{ gown(Elise) }} contained reminded {{ him(Gerin) }} acutely of how much little {{ girls(Elise) }} could grow in ten years. {{ He(Gerin) }} vaguely regretted {{ she(Elise) }} did not follow the bare-necked southern style, but the {{ gown(Elise) }} showed plenty as it was. Long brown hair flowed over {{ herd(Elise) }} creamy shoulders.
{{ Herd(Elise) }} laughing green eyes held {{ him(Gerin) }}. "I remember you well, {{ lord(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}," {{ she(Elise) }} said. "When last you were here, you bounced me on your knee. Times change, though."
"So they do, my {{ lady(Elise) }}," {{ he(Gerin) }} agreed mournfully.
{{ He(Gerin) }} took a seat without much attention to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} benchmates, and found {{ himself(Gerin) }} between {{Rihwin}} and {{Wolfar}}. "Bounced {{ her(Elise) }} on your knee, forsooth?" {{Rihwin}} said, soft voice turning words in elaborate southern patterns. "I should be less than a truthteller were I to say some such idea had not crossed my mind at one time or another, and I daresay the minds of others here as well. And now we meet a {{ man(Gerin) }} who has accomplished the fondest dreams of a double hand of nobles and more: in good truth, a {{ fellow(Gerin) }} manifestly to be watched with the greatest of care."
{{ He(Rihwin) }} raised a mug in mocking salute, but {{Gerin}} thought the smile on {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} handsome face real. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} drained {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own tankard in return. {{Rihwin}} seemed to wince as {{ he(Rihwin) }} downed {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} ale; no doubt {{ he(Rihwin) }} preferred wine. Most southerners did, but grapes grew poorly north of the Kirs.
An elbow nudged {{Gerin}}'s ribs. {{Wolfar}} grinned at {{ him(Gerin) }}, displaying snaggled teeth. {{Gerin}} suspected {{ he(Wolfar) }} had were-blood in {{ him(Wolfar) }}. {{ Hisd(Wolfar) }} hairiness varied marvelously as the moons whirled through the sky. Three years before, when Nothos and Math were full at the same time, a tale went round that {{ he(Wolfar) }}'d gone all alone into the forests of the Trokmoi and slain folk with {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} teeth.
At the moment, {{ he(Wolfar) }} seemed civil—and civilized—enough. "How fare you, Fox?" {{ he(Wolfar) }} asked.
"Well enough, until now," {{Gerin}} answered smoothly. From the corner of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eye, {{ he(Gerin) }} saw {{Rihwin}} cock an eyebrow in an expression {{ he(Gerin) }} was more used to feeling on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own face than seeing on another. {{ He(Gerin) }} felt {{ he(Gerin) }} had passed an obscure test.
{{ Hisd(Gerin) }} belly was growling when the repast appeared. {{Ricolf}}'s cooks did not have the spices and condiments the Fox had known south of the mountains, but the food was good and they did no violence to it. There was beef both roasted and boiled, fowls fried crisp and brown, mutton, ribs of pork cooked in a tangy sauce, creamy cheese with a firm, tasty skin, thick soup from the stockpot, and mountains of fresh-baked bread. {{Ricolf}}'s good beer was an added delight. Serving wenches ran here and there, food-laden bronze platters in their hands, trying to keep ahead of the gobbling suitors.
{{Rihwin}} and one or two others discreetly patted the servants as they went by. {{Gerin}} understood their caution; it would not have done for a noble intent on marrying {{Ricolf}}'s {{ daughter(Elise) }} to get one of {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} servants in trouble. Van had no such worries. When a well-made {{ lass(lover2) }} came by, {{ he(Van) }} kissed {{ her(lover2) }} and gave {{ herd(lover2) }} a squeeze. {{ She(lover2) }} squealed and almost dropped {{ herd(lover2) }} tray. {{ Herd(lover2) }} face was red as {{ she(lover2) }} pulled away, but {{ she(lover2) }} smiled back at {{ him(Van) }}.
The feasters tossed gnawed bones onto the hall's dirt floor, where {{Ricolf}}'s dogs snarled and fought over them. Whenever the battles grew too noisy, a couple of cleaned-up serfs in stout boots toed the hounds apart. Even so, the din was overpowering.
So were the smells. The odors of dog and man vied with the smell of cooking meat. Smoke from the torches and the great hearth next to {{Dyaus}}' altar hung in a choking cloud.
{{Gerin}} ate until {{ he(Gerin) }} could barely move, then settled back, replete and happy. Everyone rose as {{Elise}} made {{ herd(Elise) }} exit, flanked by two {{ maid(Elise)}}s. When {{ she(Elise) }} was gone, the serious drinking and gambling began.
{{Wolfar}}, {{Gerin}} knew, was a fanatic for dicing, but tonight, for some reason, {{ he(Wolfar) }} declined to enter the game. "I never bet in my life," {{ he(Wolfar) }} declared loftily, pretending not to hear the Fox's snort.
"I wish I could say that," a loser mourned as {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} bet was scooped up.
"Why can't you? {{Wolfar}} just did," {{Rihwin}} said. {{Gerin}} grinned at {{ him(Rihwin) }} with genuine liking. In the southlands the smooth insult was a fine art, one the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had enjoyed but one too subtle for Castle Fox. {{Rihwin}} nodded back; maybe {{ he(Rihwin) }} had aimed the remark for {{Gerin}}'s ears. It always warmed the Fox when a southerner born and bred took {{ him(Gerin) }} for an equal. They were a snobbish lot on the other side of the Kirs. That {{Rihwin}}'s target was {{Wolfar}} only made things more delightful.
{{Rihwin}} had a capacity for ale that belied {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} soft looks. {{Gerin}} valiantly tried to keep up, empyting {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mug again and again until the room spun as {{ he(Gerin) }} rose. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} last clear memory was of Van howling out a nomad battlesong and accompanying {{ himself(Van) }} with the flat of {{ hisd(Van) }} blade on the tabletop.
To {{ hisd(Gerin) }} surprise, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} woke up the next morning in a bed. {{ He(Gerin) }} had scant notion of how or when {{ he(Gerin) }}'d reached it. Little wails of delight and Van's hoarse chuckle from the next room told {{ him(Gerin) }} the outlander had not wasted {{ hisd(Van) }} night sleeping.
The Fox found a bucket of cold water outside {{ hisd(Gerin) }} door. {{ He(Gerin) }} poured half of it over {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. Spluttering, {{ he(Gerin) }} walked down the passageway and into the yard. {{ He(Gerin) }} found {{Ricolf}} there, halfheartedly practicing with the bow. Though the older {{ man(Ricolf) }} had not tried to pace {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} guests, {{ he(Ricolf) }} looked wan.
"Does this sort of thing happen every night?" {{Gerin}} asked.
"The gods forbid! Were it so, I'd have been long dead. No, I plan to announce my choice tonight, and it would be less than natural if tension didn't build. For near a year I've seen these people}—all but Sigiber the South, poor wight, who got a spear through {{ hisd(Gerin) }} middle—in battle, heard them talk, watched them. Aye, my mind's made up at last."
"Who?"
"Can you keep it quiet? No, that's a foolish question; you could before, pup though you were, and it's not the sort of thing to change in a {{ man(Gerin) }}. For all {{ hisd(Gerin) }} affected ways—I know some call {{ him(Gerin) }} 'Fop' and not 'Fox'—{{Rihwin}} is easily the best of them. After {{ him(Rihwin) }}, perhaps, would be {{Wolfar}}, but a long way back."
"{{Wolfar}}?" {{Gerin}} was amazed. "You can't mean it?"
"Aye, I do. I know of your trouble with {{ him(Wolfar) }}, but you can't deny {{ he(Wolfar) }}'s a doughty warrior. {{ He(Wolfar) }}'s not as slow of wit as {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} looks would make you think, either."
"{{ He(Wolfar) }}'s a mean one, though. Once in hand-to-hand {{ he(Wolfar) }} almost bit my ear off." Something else occurred to the Fox. "What of your {{ daughter(Elise) }}? If the choice were {{ hers(Elise) }}, whom would {{ she(Elise) }} pick?"
It was {{Ricolf}}'s turn for surprise. "What does that matter? {{ She(Elise) }}'ll do as I bid {{ her(Elise) }}." {{ He(Ricolf) }} turned back to {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} archery.
{{Gerin}} was tempted to leave, but knew {{ hisd(Gerin) }} old friend would think {{ him(Gerin) }} rude to vanish on the eve of the betrothal. {{ He(Gerin) }} spent the day relaxing, glancing at the couple of books {{Ricolf}} owned, and making light talk with some of the suitors.
Van emerged in the early afternoon, a smile on {{ hisd(Van) }} face. The outlander was rubbing a callus on {{ hisd(Van) }} right forefinger when {{ he(Van) }} found {{Gerin}}. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} remembered the heavy silver ring {{ he(Van) }}'d worn there. Van explained, "It's only right to give the {{ lass(lover2) }}ie something to remember me by."
"You, I don't think {{ she(lover2) }}'s likely to forget."
"I suppose not," Van said happily.
A bit before sunset, a wandering minstrel appeared outside {{Ricolf}}'s gate and prayed shelter for the night. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} granted it, on condition that {{ he(Gerin) }} sing after {{Elise}}'s betrothal was announced. The minstrel, whose name was {{Tassilo}}, agreed at once. "How not?" {{ he(Tassilo) }} said. "After all, 'tis the purpose of a singer to sing."
The evening meal was like the one the night before. Tonight, though, {{Ricolf}} opened jugs of wine brought up from the south along with griffin-headed ivory rhytons and eared cups of finest Sithonian ware—beautiful scenes of hunting, drinking, and the deeds of the gods were painted under their glaze. {{Gerin}}'s thrifty soul quailed when {{ he(Gerin) }} thought of what {{Ricolf}} must have spent.
{{Rihwin}}, who seemed to expect {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} coming triumph and hadn't tasted the wine {{ he(Rihwin) }} loved in a year, began pouring it down almost faster than {{ he(Rihwin) }} could be served. {{ He(Rihwin) }} held it well at first, regaling {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} comrades with bits of gossip from the {{Emperor}}'s court. Though this was a year old, most of it was new to {{Gerin}}.
The feasters finished. An expectant hush fell on the hall.
Just as {{Ricolf}} began to rise, {{Rihwin}} suddenly clambered onto the table. The boards creaked. Voice wine-blurred, {{Rihwin}} called out, "Ha, bard, play me a tune, and make it a lively one!"
{{Tassilo}}, who had looked at the bottom of {{ hisd(Tassilo) }} cup more than once {{ himself(Tassilo) }}, struck fiery music from {{ hisd(Tassilo) }} mandolin. {{Rihwin}} went into a northern dance. {{Gerin}} stared at {{ him(Rihwin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} was sure {{Ricolf}} would not like this. But {{Rihwin}} found the jig too sedate. {{ He(Rihwin) }} shifted in midstep to a wild, stamping nomad dance.
{{Ricolf}}, watching the un{{ man(Rihwin) }}ly performance, looked like a {{ man(Ricolf) }} bathing in hellfire. {{ He(Ricolf) }} had all but beggared {{ himself(Ricolf) }} to provide the best for these people and make {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} holding as much like the elegant southland as {{ he(Ricolf) }} could. Was this {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} reward?
Then, with a howl, {{Rihwin}} stood on {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} hands and kicked {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} legs in the air in time to the music. {{ Hisd(Rihwin) }} toga fell limply around {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} ears. {{ Hed(Rihwin) }} wore nothing under it.
At that spectacle, the servants hustled {{Elise}} from the hall. {{Gerin}} did not quite catch {{ herd(Elise) }} expression, but thought amusement a large part of it.
In agony, {{Ricolf}} cried, "{{Rihwin}}, you have danced your {{ wife(Elise) }} away!"
"I could hardly care less," {{Rihwin}} said cheerfully. "Play on, minstrel!"
<h2>III</h2>
After that, there was little {{Ricolf}} could do. {{ He(Ricolf) }} tried to make the best of the fiasco by proclaiming to everyone that {{Wolfar}} of the Axe was {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} true choice as {{Elise}}'s {{ groomm(Wolfar) }}. {{Wolfar}} acknowledged {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} honor with a gracious grunt, which only disconcerted {{Ricolf}} more. There were scattered cheers, including a sardonic one from {{Rihwin}}.
{{Gerin}} muttered insincere congratulations to {{Wolfar}}. Then {{ he(Gerin) }} left the feast, claiming {{ he(Gerin) }} wanted to make an early start in the morning. That held just enough truth to make mannerly {{ hisd(Gerin) }} escape from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} enemy's triumph. Van had already disappeared with another {{ wench(lover2) }} and a jug of wine. Ignoring the raucous celebration in the great hall, {{Gerin}} blew out the little flame flickering from the middle fingertip of the hand-shaped clay lamp by {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bed and fell asleep.
{{ He(Gerin) }} woke to the sound of someone fumbling at the barred door. Elleb's crescent, just now topping the walls of {{Ricolf}}'s keep, peeped through the east-facing slit window and sent a pale pink stripe of light across the bed to the door. Sunrise was still two or three hours away.
Head aching, {{Gerin}} groped for {{ hisd(Gerin) }} clothes. {{ He(Gerin) }} slid into {{ trousers(Gerin) }}, but wrapped {{ hisd(Gerin) }} tunic round {{ hisd(Gerin) }} right arm for a shield. The fumbling went on. Knife in hand, {{ he(Gerin) }} padded to the door and flung it open.
Whatever outcry {{ he(Gerin) }} had intended clogged in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} throat. "Great {{Dyaus}}, {{Elise}}, what are you doing here?" {{ he(Gerin) }} gurgled. {{ He(Gerin) }} almost had not known {{ her(Elise) }}. No longer was {{ she(Elise) }} in finery and bedecked. {{ She(Elise) }} wore stout boots, breeches, and a sheepskin jacket so baggy it all but hid {{ herd(Elise) }} shape. A knife swung at {{ herd(Elise) }} belt. {{ Herd(Elise) }} hair was tucked up under a shapeless leather traveler's hat.
For a long moment, {{ she(Elise) }} stared at the blade in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} left hand. Its nicked edge glittered in the fading light of the hallway torches. Then {{ she(Elise) }} brushed past the stunned Fox and shut the door behind them. Voice low and fast, {{ she(Elise) }} said, "I need help, {{ lord(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}, and of all the people here, I think I can only ask it of you. I was willing to try my {{ father(Ricolf) }}'s idiot scheme as long as I thought I had some chance of getting a {{ husband(Wolfar) }} I could endure, but {{Wolfar}} of the Axe—"
{{Gerin}} wished {{ he(Gerin) }} had not drunk so much. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} head still buzzed and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} wits were slow. "All the northland knows I have no love for {{Wolfar}}, but what do you want of me?" {{ he(Gerin) }} asked, already afraid {{ he(Gerin) }} knew the answer.
{{ She(Elise) }} looked up at {{ him(Gerin) }}, eyes enormous in the gloom. "I know you are going to the capital—take me with you! My {{ mother-opp(Ricolf) }} was of a southern house, and I have kin there. I'd be no burden to you. I've been daughter and son both to my {{ father(Ricolf) }}, and I can live from the land like any warrior—"
"Don't you see I can't?" {{Gerin}} broke in. "It's impossible. What would my life be worth if someone were to find you here even now?" Alarmed at that, {{ he(Gerin) }} added, "By the gods, where are your servants?"
"As soon as I knew my {{ father(Ricolf) }} had chosen {{Wolfar}}, I put a sleeping powder in their cups. The ninnies were still clucking over poor besotted {{Rihwin}}. {{ He(Rihwin) }} wasn't a bad {{ fellow(Rihwin) }}, for all {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} silly ways."
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} felt a twinge of annoyance at {{ her(Elise) }} mentioning the drunken fool with kindness, but stifled it. {{ He(Gerin) }} said, "That's one for you, then. But why won't {{Ricolf}} think I ran off with you against your will?"
"Nothing simpler: I let a note in my room saying just what I was doing, and why. There are things in it only {{ he(Ricolf) }} and I know; {{ he(Ricolf) }}'d not think it forced from me."
{{Gerin}} stared. {{ Women(Elise) }} who read and wrote were not of the ordinary sort. Well, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought, I've already found that out. But {{ he(Gerin) }} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head, saying, "You have all the answers, it seems. But answer me this: would you have me break the sacred oath of guest-friendship I hold with your {{ father(Ricolf) }}? No luck comes to the oath-breaker; gods and men alike turn from {{ him(Ricolf) }}."
{{ She(Elise) }} inspected {{ him(Elise) }}. {{ Herd(Elise) }} eyes filled with tears. {{ He(Gerin) }} felt {{ himself(Gerin) }} flinch under {{ herd(Elise) }} gaze. "You've forgotten the oath you gave me all those years ago, then?" {{ she(Elise) }} asked bitterly. "How old was I? Eight? Ten? I don't know, but I've remembered from then till now that you treated me like a real person, not just a brat underfoot. You swore if ever I needed you, there you would be. Is an oath less an oath because given to a child? Am I less a person because I have no beard? You called on {{Dyaus}}; by {{Dyaus}}, {{ lord(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}, could you see yourself wed to {{Wolfar}}, were you in my place?" The tears slid down {{ herd(Elise) }} cheeks.
"No," {{ he(Gerin) }} sighed, understanding what the truth meant but unable to lie to {{ her(Elise) }}.
"No more could I. I would sooner die."
"There's no need of that," {{ he(Gerin) }} said, awkwardly patting {{ herd(Elise) }} shoulder. {{ He(Gerin) }} shrugged on the rolled-up tunic and climbed into {{ hisd(Gerin) }} cuirass. "What sort of gear do you have?"
"No need to worry about that. I've already stowed it in your wagon."
{{ He(Gerin) }} threw {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hands in the air. "I might have known. You know, Van will call me nine different kinds of fool, and every one of them true, but you'll be useful to have around. You could talk a longtooth into eating parsnips.
"Wait here," {{ he(Gerin) }} added, and stepped into the hall. {{ He(Gerin) }} tried Van's door. It was barred. {{ He(Gerin) }} swore under {{ hisd(Gerin) }} breath. {{ He(Gerin) }} was about to tap when the door flew open. Van loomed over {{ him(Gerin) }}, naked as the day {{ he(Van) }} was born. {{ Hisd(Van) }} mace checked its downward arc inches from the Fox's head.
"Captain, what in the five hells are you up to?" {{ he(Van) }} hissed. Behind {{ him(Van) }}, a {{ woman(lover2) }} made drowsy complaint. In the half-light, the curve of {{ herd(lover2) }} hip and thigh made an inviting shadow on the bed. "It's all right, love," the outlander reassured {{ her(lover2) }}. {{ She(lover2) }} sighed and went back to sleep. Van turned to {{Gerin}}: "Don't come scratching round my door. It isn't healthy."
"So I see. Now will you put that fornicating thing down and listen to me?"
When the {{ baron(Gerin) }} finished, there was nothing but astonishment on Van's face. {{ He(Van) }} whistled softly. "I will be damned. Spend two years thinking a {{ man(Gerin) }} stodgy and then {{ he(Gerin) }} does this to you." {{ Hisd(Van) }} shoulders shook with suppressed mirth. "What are you standing here gawking for? Go on, get the horses hitched up; I'll be with you in a few minutes." Softly but firmly, {{ he(Van) }} shut the door in {{Gerin}}'s face.
Blinking, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} retrieved {{Elise}} and hurried down the hallway. The only sounds were faint cracklings from the guttering torches and snoring from behind almost every door. {{Gerin}} thanked the gods for the flooring of rammed earth. On planking, the nails in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sandals would have clicked like the wooden snappers some Sithonian dancers wore on their fingers.
"How can I thank you?" {{Elise}} whispered. "I—" {{Gerin}} clamped a hand over {{ herd(Elise) }} mouth: someone else was in the hall.
* * *
{{Wolfar}}, stumbling to {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} bed, had rarely felt better in {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} life. {{ He(Wolfar) }} had spent most of the night thinking of {{Gerin}} chopped into dogmeat after {{ he(Gerin) }} took over {{Ricolf}}'s lands as well as {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} own; {{Elise}} was a tasty baggage, too. Every other feaster had long since either lurched off to bed or slid under the table, but {{Wolfar}}, buoyed by visions of glory and mayhem, was still mostly {{ himself(Wolfar) }} after drinking them all down.
{{ He(Wolfar) }} gaped when {{Gerin}} appeared before {{ him(Wolfar) }}. "Ah, the Fox," {{ he(Wolfar) }} said jovially. "I was just thinking of you." {{ Hisd(Wolfar) }} piggy eyes went wide when {{ he(Wolfar) }} saw the {{ baron(Gerin) }}'s companion.
{{Gerin}} saw {{Wolfar}} fill {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} lungs to shout. {{ He(Gerin) }} snatched a dead torch from its dragon-headed bronze sconce and broke it over {{ hisd(Gerin) }} rival's bald spot. {{Wolfar}} sank without a sound, mouth still open. {{Gerin}} and {{Elise}} darted for the stables, not knowing how long {{ he(Wolfar) }} would stay stunned.
They slowed once they got outside the castle. Attracting the gate crew's attention was the last thing they wanted.
The horses looked resentful as {{Gerin}} harnessed them. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} fingers leaped over the leather straps. Each had to go in its proper place, lest the whole harness come apart. {{ He(Gerin) }} expected an alarm at any moment. But the horses were hitched and {{Elise}} hidden under blankets in the back of the wagon, and all stayed quiet. Van, however, did not come. {{Gerin}} waited and worried.
A footfall in the doorway made {{ him(Gerin) }} whirl. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} hand leaped for {{ hisd(Gerin) }} swordhilt, but that gigantic silhouette could only belong to one {{ man(Van) }}. "What kept you?" the {{ baron(Gerin) }} barked.
"Some things, a {{ gentleman(Van) }} never hurries," Van said with dignity. "You laid {{Wolfar}} out cold as a cod; {{ he(Wolfar) }}'ll have {{ himself(Wolfar) }} a ten-day headache. Now let's be off, shall we? Ah, you've already got a torch lit. Good. Here, start another. The light may keep the worst of the ghosts away. Or, of course, it may not. I know few folk who've gone night-faring, and fewer still who came back again, but now it's a needful thing, I think."
{{ He(Van) }} climbed aboard, took the reins, and set the horses moving. Harness jingling, they rode up to the gate. A couple of {{Ricolf}}'s hounds sniffed about the wagon's wheels. Van flicked them away with {{ hisd(Van) }} whip.
The gate guards made no move to let down the drawbridge. They looked curiously at Van and {{Gerin}}. One asked, "{{ Lord(Gerin) }}, why are you on your way so early?"
Van stopped breathing. It was a question for which {{ he(Van) }} had no good answer. But {{Gerin}} only grinned a lopsided grin. {{ He(Gerin) }} laughed at the guards and said, "I'm running away with {{Ricolf}}'s {{ daughter(Elise) }}; {{ she(Elise) }}'s much too good for anyone here."
The soldier shook {{ hisd(retainer1) }} head. "Ask a question like that and you deserve whatever answer you get, I suppose. Come on, Vukov," {{ he(retainer1) }} said to the other watch{{ man(retainer1) }}, "let down the bridge. If they want to take their chances with the ghosts, it's their affair and none of mine."
Smothering a yawn, Vukov helped {{ hisd(retainer1) }} comrade with the winch. The bridge slowly lowered, then dropped the last few feet with a thump. To {{Gerin}}, the clop of the horses' hooves on it seemed the loudest thing in the world.
Trying not to bellow laughter, Van wheezed and choked. Between splutters, {{ he(Van) }} said, "Captain, that was the most outrageous thing I've ever seen! You've got to promise me you'll never, ever let me gamble with you. I have better things to do than throwing my money away."
"It's ill-done to lie in the house of a guest-friend. If {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} guards choose not to believe, why, that's their affair and none of mine." {{Gerin}} shrugged, mimicking the guardsman.
As soon as they left the shelter of {{Ricolf}}'s keep, the ghosts were on them, keening loss and shrieking resentment of any who still kept warm blood in their veins. Without the boon of blood to placate them, they sent an icy blast of terror down on the travelers.
The horses rolled their eyes, shying at things only they saw. {{Gerin}} stopped {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ears with {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fingers in a vain effort to shut out the ghosts' wails. {{ He(Gerin) }} saw Van work {{ hisd(Van) }} massive jaw, but no word of complaint passed the outlander's lips. {{Elise}}, shivering, came up to sit with them under the scant protection the torches gave.
{{Ricolf}}'s lands shot by in a gray blur, as if Van thought to outrun the ghosts by fleeing south. The horses did not falter; rather they seemed glad to run. False dawn was touching the east with yellow light when the wagon sped past the little guardpost {{Ricolf}} kept on {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} southern border. {{Gerin}} was not much surprised to see the guards curled up asleep inside; fire and blood warded them from the night spirits. They did not stir as the wagon clattered past.
The Fox had been looking back over {{ hisd(Gerin) }} shoulder as long as {{ he(Gerin) }} was in {{Ricolf}}'s lands. When {{ he(Gerin) }} saw how Van slowed their pace once past the border, {{ he(Gerin) }} knew {{ he(Gerin) }} had not been the only one to worry. {{ He(Gerin) }} cocked an eyebrow at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend. "For all {{ hisd(Van) }} willingness to help carry off the {{ lady(Elise) }}," {{ he(Gerin) }} said to no one in particular, "I seem to notice a certain burly accomplice of mine lacking a perfect faith in the power of {{ herd(Elise) }} notes to soothe ruffled tempers."
"If all that noise means me," Van rumbled, "then you've hit in the center of the target. It would have been downright awkward to have to explain to a horde of warriors just what I was doing with their {{ lord(Ricolf) }}'s {{ daughter(Elise) }}."
{{Elise}} made a face at {{ him(Van) }}. {{ She(Elise) }}, at least, seemed confident there would be no followers. {{Gerin}} wondered what it took to put trust in someone unknown for a double handful of years. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} mind stalked round the idea like a cat with ruffled fur. {{ He(Gerin) }} was still astonished any pleading of {{ hers(Elise) }} could have convinced {{ him(Gerin) }} to bring {{ her(Elise) }} along.
At last the sun touched the eastern horizon, spilling out ruddy light like a huge hand pouring wine from a jug. The ghosts gave a last frightened moan and returned to whatever gloomy haunts they inhabited during the day.
The morning wore on with no sign of anyone on {{Gerin}}'s trail, but {{ he(Gerin) }} still felt uneasy for no reason {{ he(Gerin) }} could name. It could not have been the land. Save for the High Kirs, now a deep blue shadow on the southern skyline, nothing was much different from what {{ he(Gerin) }} knew in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own barony.
Meadow and forest alternated, and if there were a few more elms and oaks and a few less pines and maples, that mattered little. The woods did grow closer to the road than the Fox would have liked: south of {{Ricolf}}'s holding, the highway marked the boundaries of two barons said to be rivals, and to {{Gerin}}'s way of thinking they should have kept the undergrowth well trimmed so no one could use it for cover.
Once a little stream wound close by the roadway. When Van pulled off to water the horses and let them rest for a few minutes, frogs and turtles leaped from mossy rocks and churned away in senseless terror, just as they would have near Fox Keep. No, the Fox thought as {{ he(Gerin) }} stared back at a suspicious turtle, the land was not what troubled {{ him(Gerin) }}.
The peasants seemed much the same, too. They lived in little villages of wattle and daub, the community oxen housed about as well as the people. Scrawny chickens picked around cottages and squawked warnings at dogs, who snarled back. Little naked herdboys guided flocks of sheep and cattle with sticks, helped by the shortlegged brown and white dogs native to the north country.  Men and women in colorless homespun worked in the fields, as hard as the draft animals laboring with them.
Not until {{Gerin}} lifted {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eyes to the keeps could {{ he(Gerin) }} finger what troubled {{ him(Gerin) }}. Castles crowned many hills, but here and there the banks of their moats were beginning to crumble into the water. Some lesser barons let stands of trees big enough to shelter scores of warriors grow almost within bowshot of their walls.
{{Gerin}} had no desire to claim shelter from any of these nobles. The few {{ he(Gerin) }} saw on the road distressed {{ him(Gerin) }}. Their chariots were decorated with inlays of gold and bright stones, but plainly had never seen combat. More than one wore cloth instead of mail. What cuirasses were to be seen were covered with studs and curlicues of bronze: beautiful to look at, but sure to catch and hold a spearpoint.
The footsoldiers were not much better. They were well armed, but soft jaws and thick middles said they were unblooded troops. Behind the shield of the border, where the Trokmoi were always ready to pounce on the weak, Elabon's northern province was starting to rot.
Van saw it too. "This land is ripe for the taking," {{ he(Van) }} said. {{Gerin}} could only nod.
The sun rose high and hot. {{Gerin}} felt the sweat trickle down {{ hisd(Gerin) }} back and chest. {{ He(Gerin) }} wished {{ he(Gerin) }} could scratch through {{ hisd(Gerin) }} armor.
With fairer skin, Van suffered more, tanned though {{ he(Van) }} was. {{ He(Van) }} finally took off {{ hisd(Van) }} proud helm and carefully stowed it in the back of the wagon, then poured over {{ hisd(Van) }} head a bucket of cool water from the brook where they had stopped. {{ He(Van) }} puffed and snorted as the water poured down {{ hisd(Van) }} face and dripped through {{ hisd(Van) }} {{ beard(Van) }}. "Ahhh!" {{ he(Van) }} said. "That's better, even if I do sound like a whale coming up for air."
"A whale?" {{Elise}} said. {{ She(Elise) }} had shed {{ herd(Elise) }} jacket. In tunic and trousers, {{ she(Elise) }} was more comfortable than either of the warriros. {{ Herd(Elise) }} hat {{ she(Elise) }} kept on, for {{ herd(Elise) }} fairness was not like that of Van, who grew golden under the sun: {{ she(Elise) }} would burn and freckle and peel and never really tan at all. {{ She(Elise) }} went on, "I've heard the word. Some kind of fish, is it not? I've never seen one."
"Nor I," {{Gerin}} said. "The farthest I've traveled is to the capital, and there are no whales in the Inner Seas."
"Well, captain, I'll tell you—and you, my {{ lady(Elise) }}—I've seen whales right enough, and closer than I wanted, too. Do you know the land called Mabalal?"
{{Elise}} shook {{ herd(Elise) }} head. {{Gerin}} said, "I've heard the name. It's far to the south and east, I think."
"That's the one, captain. And sultry—why, this is nothing beside what it's like there. I thought I'd melt like a lump of wax in a fire. The people are little and dark, and they seem to like it well enough. For all their swarthy hides, the {{ girls(lover2) }} are not uncomely, and what they do—" Van abruptly broke off. {{Gerin}} was amused to see {{ hisd(Gerin) }} huge friend could blush.
"But I was talking about whales," Van went on. "They come in all sizes, and the sailors like the little ones, and wouldn't think of harming them. But the big ones hate men, and sink whatever boats they can. Now, one of them had lived outside the harbor at Jalor—that's the capital thereabouts—for years, and {{ he(whale) }}'d sunk maybe twenty ships. {{ He(whale) }} had a reddish skin they knew {{ him(whale) }} by, and they called {{ him(whale) }} 'Old Crimson,' since crimson is the color their kings wear. Five times they'd tried to kill {{ him(whale) }}, and neither of the two harpooners who lived was whole.
"It got so bad the captains wouldn't ship out of Jalor, and if they did they couldn't find a soul to man the oars. Didn't that put a pretty squeeze on the merchants! So they decided to have another go at {{ him(whale) }}, and when one of their big traders, a {{ fellow(Kariri) }} named Kariri, saw me in some dive, {{ he(Kariri) }} thought I would make a good oarsman, having more in the way of muscle than {{ hisd(Kariri) }} countrymen. I was game; things had been dull since I'd had to leave Shanda, and the price {{ he(Kariri) }} promised was good. It had to be, to get rowers for that boat! Most of us were foreigners of one kind or another: the folk of Jalor knew better.
"So off we sailed, the only ship in the water, though the docks and beach were black with people watching. Now, in those part the way they lure whales is this: they catch a lot of fat tunny and pickle them with salt in big jars, and when they're nice and ripe, they soak rags in the fish-grease and dump 'em in the water where they think the whales are. The first thing any of us knew of Old Crimson being round was a sort of a loud hiss and a cloud of evil-smelling steam. Whales aren't like other fish. They have to come to the surface every so often to get a breath of air and blow out the old. That's what {{ he(whale) }}'d done, not fifty yards to starboard.
"I tell you, I missed a stroke, and I wasn't the only one. Then {{ he(whale) }} came all the way out of the water, and I never want to see such a sight again. That ruddy hide of {{ hisd(whale) }} was all scarred and torn from the ships {{ he(whale) }}'d sunk, and I saw three spearpoints stuck in just back of {{ hisd(whale) }} head, but not deep enough to do more than drive {{ him(whale) }} mad with pain over the years. I don't lie when I say I'd've sooner been elsewhere right then. {{ He(whale) }} was bigger than our boat, and not by a little, either.
"But the harpooning crew knew what to do if they—and we—were going to come home alive. They tossed ten or twelve pounds of that pickled tunny toward the monster, and {{ he(whale) }} snapped it up. It's a funny thing, but the stuff makes whales drunk, and Old Crimson lay still in the water. If {{ he(whale) }} were a kitten, {{ he(whale) }} would have purred.
"Once that happened, the harpooners slipped out of their clothes (not that they wore much, just rags round their middles) and swam over to {{ him(whale) }}, quiet as they could. One trailed {{ hisd(whale) }} barbed harpoon, the second a little stand for it, and the third, who had more brawn than most men of Mabalal, took a big mallet with {{ him(harpooner) }}. They climbed up on Old Crimson's head, and {{ he(whale) }} never stirred. We lay dead quiet in the water, for fear of rousing {{ him(whale) }}.
"They set up the harpoon just aft of {{ hisd(whale) }} head, right behind the others that hadn't gone deep enough to kill. Then the {{ fellow(harpooner) }} with the mallet swung it up over {{ hisd(harpooner) }} head and hit the butt end of the harpoon with everything {{ he(harpooner) }} had. I swear by all the gods there are that the whale leaped clean out of the water, with the harpooners still clinging to {{ him(whale) }}. They might have screamed, but we never would have heard them. We were backing water for all we were worth, but still I saw that great tail like a fist over the bow.
"When it came down, the ship just went all to splinters. I'm hazy about what happened next, because something hit me right between the eyes. I must have grabbed an oar; the next thing I remember is being fished out of the water by one of the little boats that came out as soon as the people on shore saw Old Crimson was really dead. Thirty-four people were on our boat when we set out, and six of us lived: only one of the harpooners, the {{ fellow(harpooner) }} with the little stand.
"Anyway, the fishermen who rescued me took me to shore, and the Jalorians took the whale's carcass ashore too, for they valued the meat and oil of it. The head of the merchants' guild kissed all of us who had lived, and gave each of us a tooth worried out of the whale's head: I don't lie when I say it was more than half a foot long.
"But do you know what? I didn't make a copper more from it, for that fat merchant sitting on {{ hisd(Kariri) }} arse on the shore just called me a filthy foreigner and wouldn't pay. For all that, though, I drank my way through the grogshops for ten days straight without touching a coin of my own, and to this day no one in Jalor knows how old Kariri's warehouses burned down."
"You know," {{Gerin}} said thoughtfully, "if they were to put a line on the end of their harpoons with floats—sealed empty casks, maybe—every hundred paces or so, they could spear their whales without having to climb onto them, and if the wound didn't kill on the spot, the whales couldn't escape by diving, either."
Van stared at {{ him(Gerin) }}. "I do believe it'd work," {{ he(Van) }} said at last. "Why weren't you there then to think of it? The gods know I never would have." {{ He(Van) }} looked to {{Elise}}. "{{Gerin}}, I do believe our guest thinks my yarn would be good for making flowers grow, but not much else, though since {{ she(Elise) }}'s kind as {{ she(Elise) }} is fair {{ she(Elise) }}'s too polite to say so. Hold the reins a bit for me, will you?"
{{Elise}} started to protest, but Van was not listening to {{ her(Elise) }}. {{ He(Van) }} stepped into the back of the wagon. {{Gerin}} heard {{ him(Van) }} rummaging in the battered leather sack where {{ he(Van) }} kept {{ hisd(Van) }} treasures. After a minute or two, {{ he(Van) }} grunted in satisfaction and emerged, handing {{Elise}} what {{ he(Van) }} held.
{{Gerin}} craned {{ hisd(Gerin) }} neck to look too. It was an ivory tusk unlike any {{ he(Gerin) }} had ever seen: though no longer than the fang of the longtooth {{ he(Gerin) }} knew, this was twice as thick, and pure white, not yellowish. Someone had carved a whale and the prow of an unfamiliar ship on the tooth; the whale was tinted a delicate pink.
Seeing the {{ baron(Gerin) }}'s admiration, Van said, "A friend of mine made it while I was out roistering. You'll notice it isn't done, but I got out of Jalor in a hurry, and {{ he(Kariri) }} didn't have time to finish."
{{Elise}} was silent.
* * *
{{Gerin}} kept the reins. Van had been yawning all morning, and now {{ he(Van) }} tried to snatch some sleep in the cramped rear of the wagon. The Fox was looking for one particular dirt track of the many joining the Elabon Way. Each path had a stone post set beside it, carved with the marks of the petty barons to whose keeps the roadlets ran. It was past noon before {{Gerin}} saw the winged eye {{ he(Gerin) }} sought. {{ He(Gerin) }} almost passed it by, for the carving was so ancient that parts of it had weathered away; startling red lichens covered much of what remained.
"Where are we going?" {{Elise}} asked when {{ he(Gerin) }} turned down the track. {{ She(Elise) }} coughed as the horses kicked up dust.
"I thought you knew all my plans," {{Gerin}} said. "I'd like to hear what the {{Sibyl}} at Ikos tells me. I stopped there once before, when I went south for the first time, and {{ she(Sibyl) }} warned me I'd never be a scholar. I laughed at {{ her(Sibyl) }}, but two years later the Trokmoi killed my {{ father(Duren) }} and my {{ brother(Dagref) }}, and I had to quit the southlands."
"That I had heard," {{Elise}} said softly. "I'm sorry." {{Gerin}} could feel the truth in {{ herd(Elise) }} words. {{ He(Gerin) }} was touched, and at the same time annoyed with {{ himself(Gerin) }} for letting {{ herd(Elise) }} sympathy reach {{ him(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} felt relieved when {{ she(Elise) }} returned to {{ herd(Elise) }} original thought: "Where we go matters little to me; I simply didn't know. Any place away from {{Wolfar}} is good enough, though I've heard evil things of the country round Ikos."
"I've heard them too," {{ he(Gerin) }} admitted, "but I've never seen much to make me think them true. This road goes over the hills and through some of the deepest forest this side of the Niffet before it reaches the {{Sibyl}}'s shrine. It's said strange beasts dwell in the forest. I never saw any, though I did see tracks on the roadway that belong to no animals the outer world knows."
The more prosperous petty barons and their lands clung leechlike to the Elabon Way. A few hours' travel from it, things were poorer. Freeholders held their own plots, folk not under the dominion of any local lordling. They were of an ancient race, the folk who had been on the land between the Niffet and the High Kirs even before the coming of the Trokmoi whom the Empire had expelled. Slim and dark, they spoke the tongue of Elabon fluently enough, but among themselves used their own soft, sibilant language.
The road narrowed, becoming little more than a winding rutted lane under frowning trees. The sinking sun's light could barely reach through the green arcade overhead. {{Gerin}} jumped when a scarlet finch shot across the roadway, taken aback by the flash of color in the gloom. As the sun set, {{ he(Gerin) }} pulled off the road and behind a thick clump of trees.
{{ He(Gerin) }} routed Van from {{ hisd(Van) }} jouncing bed. Together they unharnessed the horses and let them crop what little grass grew in the shade of the tall beeches.
They had but a scanty offering for the ghosts: dried beef mixed with water. It was not really enough, but {{Gerin}} hoped it would serve. {{Elise}} wanted to take one watch. The Fox and Van said no in the same breath.
"Please yourselves," {{ she(Elise) }} shrugged, "but I could do it well enough." A knife appeared in {{ herd(Elise) }} hand and then, almost before the eye could see it, was quivering in a treetrunk twenty feet away.
{{Gerin}} was thoughtful as {{ he(Gerin) }} plucked the dagger free, but still refused. {{Elise}} looked to Van. {{ He(Gerin) }} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head and laughed: "My {{ lady(Elise) }}, I haven't been guarded by {{ ladies(Elise) }} since I was old enough to keep my {{ mother(Elise) }} from learning what I was up to. I don't plan to start over now."
{{ She(Elise) }} looked hurt, but said only, "Very well, then. Guard me well this night, heroes." {{ He(Gerin) }} half-sketched a salute as {{ she(Elise) }} slipped into {{ herd(Elise) }} bedroll.
Van, who was rested, offered to take the first watch. {{Gerin}} got under a blanket, twisted until {{ he(Gerin) }} found a position where the fewest pebbles dug into {{ him(Gerin) }}, and knew no more until Van prodded {{ him(Gerin) }} awake. "Math is down, and—what do you call the fast moon? I've forgotten."
"Tiwaz."
"That's it. As well as I can see through the trees, it'll set in an hour or so. That makes it midnight, and time for me to sleep." Van was under {{ hisd(Van) }} own blanket—the gold-and-black striped hide of some great hunting beast—and asleep with the speed of the experienced wanderer. {{Gerin}} stretched, yawned, and heard the ghosts buzz in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind like gnats.
In the dim red light of the embers, the wagon was a lump on the edge of visibility, the horses a pair of dark shadows. {{Gerin}} listened to their unhurried breathing and the chirp and rustle of tiny crawling things. An owl overhead loosed its hollow, eerie call. Somewhere not far away, a small stream chuckled to itself. A longtooth roared in the distance, and for a moment everything else was quiet.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} turned at a sound close by. {{ He(Gerin) }} saw {{Elise}} half-sitting, watching {{ him(Gerin) }}. {{ Herd(Elise) }} expression was unreadable. "Regrets?" {{ he(Gerin) }} asked, voice the barest thread of sound.
{{ Herd(Elise) }} answer was softer still. "Of course. To leave all I've ever known . . . it's no easy road, but one I have to travel."
"You could still go back."
"With {{Wolfar}}'s arms waiting? There's no returning." {{ She(Elise) }} started to say more, stopped, began again. "Do you know why I came with you? You helped me once, long ago." {{ Herd(Elise) }} eyes were looking into the past, not at {{Gerin}}. "The first time I saw you was the most woeful day of my life. I had a dog I'd raised from a pup; {{ he(Elleb) }} had a floppy ear and one of {{ hisd(Elleb) }} eyes was half blue, and because of {{ hisd(Elleb) }} red fur I called {{ him(Elleb) }} Elleb. {{ He(Elleb) }} used to like to go out and hunt rabbits, and when {{ he(Elleb) }} caught one {{ he(Elleb) }}'d bring it home to me. One day {{ he(Elleb) }} went out as {{ he(Elleb) }} always did, but {{ he(Elleb) }} didn't come back.
"I was frantic. I looked for two days before I could find {{ him(Elleb) }}, and when I did, I wished I hadn't. {{ He(Elleb) }}'d run down a little gully and caught {{ hisd(Elleb) }} hind leg in a trap."
"I remember," {{Gerin}} said, realizing why the dog Ruffian had seemed familiar. "I heard you crying and went to see what the trouble was. I was heading south to study."
"Was I crying? I suppose I was. I don't remember. All I could think of was poor Elleb's leg shredded in the jaw of the trap, and blood dried black, and the flies. The trap was chained to a stake, and I couldn't pry it loose from {{ him(Elleb) }}.
"Hurt as {{ he(Elleb) }} was, I remember {{ him(Elleb) }} growling when you came up, still trying to keep me safe. You knelt down beside me and patted {{ him(Elleb) }} and poured some water from your canteen on the ground for {{ him(Elleb) }} to drink, and then you took out your knife and did what needed to be done.
"Not many would tried to make friends with {{ him(Elleb) }} first, and not many would have sat with me afterwards and made me understand why an end to {{ hisd(Elleb) }} pain was the last gift {{ he(Elleb) }} could get from someone who loved {{ him(Elleb) }}. By the time you took me home, I really did understand it. You were kind to me, and I've never forgotten."
"And because of so small a thing you put your trust in me?"
"I did, and I have no regrets." {{ Herd(Elise) }} last words were sleep-softened.
{{Gerin}} watched Nothos and the stars peep through holes in the leafy canopy and thought about the obligations with which {{ he(Gerin) }} had saddled {{ himself(Gerin) }}. After a while, {{ he(Gerin) }} decided {{ he(Gerin) }} too had no regets. {{ He(Gerin) }} fed bits of wood to the tiny fire, slapped at the buzzing biters lured by its light, and waited for the sun to put the ghosts to rout.
At dawn {{ he(Gerin) }} woke Van. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} comrade knuckled {{ hisd(Van) }} eyes and spoke mostly in sleepy grunts as they harnessed the horses. {{Elise}} doused and covered the fire before {{Gerin}} could tend to it. They breakfasted on hard bread and smoked meat. To {{ hisd(Gerin) }} disgust, {{Gerin}} missed a shot at a fat grouse foolish enough to roost on a branch not a hundred feet away. It flapped off, wings whirring.
The track wound through the forest. Trailing shoots and damp hanging mosses hung from branches overhead, eager to snatch at anything daring to brave the wood's cool dim calm. The horses were balky. More than once Van had to touch them with the whip before they would go on.
Few birds trilled to ease the quiet. Almost the only sounds were the creaking of branches and the rustling of leaves in a breeze too soft to reach down to the road.
Once a sound almost softer than silence paced the wagon for a time. It might have been the pad of great supple feet, or perhaps nothing at all. {{Gerin}} saw—or thought {{ he(Gerin) }} saw—a pair of eyes, greener than the leaves, measuring {{ him(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} blinked or they blinked and when {{ he(Gerin) }} looked again they were gone. The rattle of the wagon's wheels was swallowed as if it had never been.
"Place gives me the bloody shivers!" Van said. To {{Gerin}}, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend's voice sounded louder than needful.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} thought the day passing faster than it was, so thick was the gloom. {{ He(Gerin) }} bit back an exclamation of surprise when they burst from shadow into the brightness of the late afternoon sun. {{ He(Gerin) }} had not realized how much the thought of camping again in the forest chilled {{ him(Gerin) }} until {{ he(Gerin) }} saw {{ he(Gerin) }} would not have to.
The hills cupped the valley in which Ikos lay. Travelers could look down on their goal before they reached it. The main road came from the southwest. {{Gerin}} could see little dots of moving people, carriages, and wagons, all come to consult the {{Sibyl}}. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} own road was less used. The border chiefs usually put more faith in edged bronze than prophecy.
A tiny grove surrounded the temple. Probably in days long past the forest had lapped down from the hilltops into the valley, but the sacred grove was all that was left of it there. The shrine's glistening marble roof stood out vividly against the green of the trees.
Around the temple proper were the houses of the priests, the attendants, and the little people who, while not really connected with the {{Sibyl}}, made their livings from those who came to see {{ her(Sibyl) }}: sellers of images and sacrificial animals, freelance soothsayers and oracle-interpreters, innkeepers and whores, and the motley crew who sold amulets, charms—and doubtless curses too.
Around the townlet were cleared fields, each small plot owned by a freeholder. {{Gerin}} knew the temple clung to the old ways. {{ He(Gerin) }} did not grudge it its customs, but still thought freeholding subversive. A peasant could not produce enough wealth to equip oneself with all the gear a proper warrior needed. Without the nobles, the border and all the land behind would have been a red tangle of warfare, with the barbarians howling down to loot and burn and kill.
"Should we go down before the light fails?" Van asked.
{{Gerin}} thought of Ikos' dingy hostels. {{ He(Gerin) }} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. "We'd get nothing done at this hour. From what I recall of the inns, we'll find fewer bugs here."
The evening meal was spare, taken from the same rations as breakfast. {{Gerin}} knew those had been packed with the idea of feeding two people, not three. {{ He(Gerin) }} reminded {{ himself(Gerin) }} to lay in more. Pretty sorry scholar you are, {{ he(Gerin) }} jeered at {{ himself(Gerin) }}—worrying over smoked sausages and journeybread.
{{ He(Gerin) }} must have said that aloud, for Van laughed and said, "Well, someone has to, after all."
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} took the first watch. In Ikos below, the lights faded until all was dark save for a central watchfire. The hills to the southwest were dotted with tiny sparks of light {{Gerin}} knew to be camps like {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own. In its grove, the temple was strange, for the light streaming out from it glowed blue instead of the comfortable red-gold of honest flame.
Magic, {{Gerin}} decided sleepily, or else the {{ god(Math) }} walking about inside. When Math's golden half-circle set, {{ he(Gerin) }} roused Van, then dove headfirst into sleep.
{{ He(Gerin) }} woke to the scent of cooking; luckier than {{ he(Gerin) }} had been the morning before, Van had bagged a squirrel and two rabbits and was stewing them. {{Elise}} contributed mushrooms and a handful of herbs. Feeling better about the world with {{ hisd(Gerin) }} belly full, {{Gerin}} hitched up the horses. The wagon rolled down the path toward the {{Sibyl}}.
<h2>IV</h2>
{{Gerin}} soon discovered {{ hisd(Gerin) }} memory had buried a lot about Ikos. First of all, the place stank. It lay under a cloud of incense so cloying that {{ he(Gerin) }} wished {{ he(Gerin) }} could stow {{ hisd(Gerin) }} nose in the wagon. Mixed with the sweet reek were the scents of charring fat from the sacrifices and the usual town odors of stale cookery, garbage, ordure, and long-unwashed animals and humanity.
The noise was as bad. {{Gerin}}'s ears had not faced such an assault since {{ he(Gerin) }} returned to the north country. It seemed as if every peddler in Ikos rolled down on the wagon, each crying their wares at the top of their lungs: swordblades, rare and potent drugs, sanctified water, oats, pretty children, savory cooked geese, collected books of prophetic verse, and countless other things. A fat bald {{ man(innkeeper) }} in greasy tunic and shiny leather apron, an innkeeper from the look of {{ him(innkeeper) }}, pushed {{ hisd(innkeeper) }} way through and bowed low before the bemused Fox, who had never seen {{ him(innkeeper) }} before. "{{ Count(Gerin) }} Stoffer, I believe?" {{ he(innkeeper) }} said, back still bent.
Patience exhausted, {{Gerin}} snapped, "Well, if you believe that, you'll believe anything, won't you?" and left the poor {{ fellow(innkeeper) }} to the jeers of {{ hisd(innkeeper) }}  fellow townspeople.
"Is this what the capital is like?" {{Elise}} asked faintly.
"It is," {{Gerin}} said, "but only if you will allow that a map is like the country it pictures."
{{ She(Elise) }} used a word {{ he(Gerin) }} had not suspected {{ she(Elise) }} knew.
Van chuckled and said, "It's the same problem both places, I think: too many people all pushed together. Captain, you're the only one of us with pockets. Have a care they aren't slit."
{{Gerin}} thumped {{ himself(Gerin) }} to make sure {{ he(Gerin) }} was still secure. "If any of these fine bucks tries it, {{ he(Gerin) }}'ll be slit {{ himself(pGerinerson) }}, and not in the pocket." {{ He(Gerin) }} suddenly grinned. "Or else not, depending on how lucky I am."
They pushed their slow way through Ikos and into the clearing round the sacred grove. The sun was already high when they reached it. They bought cheese and little bowls of barley porridge from the legion of vendors. People from every nation {{Gerin}} knew cursed and jostled one another, each trying to be the first to the divine voice on earth.
One lightly built chariot held two nomads from the eastern plains. They were little and lithe, flat of face and dark of skin, with scraggly caricatures of beards dangling from their chins. They dressed in wolfskin jackets and leather trousers, and bore double-curved bows reinforced with sinew. They carried small leather shields on their left arms; one was bossed with a golden panther, the other with a leaping stag. When {{Van}} noticed them, {{ he(Van) }} shouted something in a language that sounded like hissing snakes. Their slanted eyes lit as they gave eager answer.
There were Kizzuwatnans in heavy carts hauled by straining donkeys: squat, heavy-boned men with swarthy skins; broad, hook-nosed faces; and liquid, mournful eyes. Their hair and beards curled in ringlets. They wore long linen tunics that reached to their knees.
There were a few Sithonians, though most of them preferred the oracle at Pronni in their own country. Slimmer and fairer than the Kizzuwatnans, they wore woolen mantles with brightly dyed edgings. They scornfully peered about from under broad-brimmed straw hats: though they had been subjects of the Empire for five centuries, they still saw themselves as something of an elite, and looked down on their Elabonian overlords as muscular dullards.
Even an Urfa from the deserts of the far south had come to Ikos. {{ He(Urfa) }} must have ridden all the way around Elabon's Greater Inner Sea, for {{ he(Urfa) }} was still perched atop {{ hisd(Urfa) }} camel. {{Gerin}} looked at its reins and saddle with interest, thinking how fascinated {{Duin}} would have been. The desert-dweller peered down at the wains and chariots around {{ him(Urfa) }}. {{ He(Urfa) }} growled guttural warning when they came too close. That was seldom; horses shied from {{ hisd(Urfa) }} evil-looking mount.
The Urfa was wrapped in a robe of grimy wool. Eyes and teeth flashed in a face darkened by dirt and long years of sun. Save for a nose even larger than the Kizzuwatnans', {{ hisd(Urfa) }} features were delicate, almost {{ girl(Urfa) }}ish. {{ He(Urfa) }} wore a thin {{ beard(Urfa) }} and, for all {{ hisd(Urfa) }} filth, seemed to think {{ himself(Urfa) }} the {{ lord(Urfa) }} of creation.
{{Gerin}} had a hard time naming some of the other outlanders. Van claimed one black-haired, fair-skinned giant belonged to the Gradi, who lived north of the Trokmoi. The {{ man(Gradi) }} was afoot, and sweating in {{ hisd(Gradi) }} furs. {{ He(Gradi) }} carried a stout mace and a short-handled throwing axe. {{Gerin}} knew almost nothing of the Gradi, but Van spoke of them with casual familiarity.
"Do you know their tongue?" {{Elise}} asked.
"Aye, a bit," Van said.
"Just how many languages do you know?" {{Gerin}} asked.
"Well, if you mean to say hello in, and maybe swear a bit, gods, I've lost track long since. Tongues I know fairly well, though, perhaps ten or a dozen. Something like that."
"Which is your own?" {{Elise}} asked.
"My {{ lady(Elise) }}," Van said, with something as close to embarrassment as {{ hisd(Van) }} deep voice could produce, "I've been on the road a lot of years now. After so long, where I started matters little."
{{Gerin}} grinned wryly; {{ he(Gerin) }}'d got much the same answer when {{ he(Gerin) }} asked that question. {{Elise}} looked to want to pursue it further, but held {{ herd(Elise) }} tongue.
One group of foreigners the Fox knew only too well: the Trokmoi. Three chieftains had come to consult the {{Sibyl}}. Their chariots stayed together in the disorder.
They were from deep in the northern woods: {{Gerin}}, who knew the clans on the far side of the border as well as {{ he(Gerin) }} knew the nobles warding it, recognized none of them, nor were the clan patterns of bright checks on their drivers' tunics familiar to {{ him(Gerin) }}. Chiefs and drivers alike were tall thin men; four had red hair and two were blond. All wore their hair long and had huge drooping mustachioes, though they shaved their cheeks and chins. Two clutched jugs of ale to themselves; another wore a necklace of human ears.
{{ Priests(eunuch)}} circulated through the crowd. {{Gerin}} looked with scant liking at the one approaching the wagon. A robe of gold brocade was stretched across {{ hisd(eunuch) }} over-ample belly, and {{ hisd(eunuch) }} {{beard2m(eunuch)}}less cheeks shone pink. Everything about {{ him(eunuch) }} was round and soft, from {{ hisd(eunuch) }} limpid blue eyes to the toes peeking sausage-like from {{ hisd(eunuch) }} sandals. {{ He(eunuch) }} was a {{eunuch}}, for the {{ god(Dyaus) }} accepted no whole {{ man(eunuch) }} as {{ hisd(Dyaus) }} servitor.
The tip of {{ hisd(eunuch) }} tongue played redly across {{ hisd(eunuch) }} lips as {{ he(eunuch) }} asked, "What would your business be, gentles, with the {{Sibyl}} of my {{ lord(Biton) }} {{Biton}}?" {{ Hisd(eunuch) }} voice was soft and sticky, like the caress of a hand dripping with honey.
"I'd sooner not speak of it in public," {{Gerin}} said.
"Quite, quite. Your servant Falfarun most definitely agrees. You have, though, a suitably appropriate offering for the {{ god(Dyaus) }}, I hope?"
"I think so." {{Gerin}} swung a purse into Falfarun's pudgy fist.
The {{ priest(eunuch) }}'s face was blank. "Doubtless all will be well when your question is heard."
"I do hope, my dear Falfarun, it will be heard soon," {{Gerin}} said in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} suavest voice. {{ He(Gerin) }} handed the {{ priest(eunuch) }} another, larger purse, which vanished into a fold of Falfarun's robe.
"Indeed. Yes, indeed. Come this way, if you please." Falfarun neared briskness as {{ he(eunuch) }} elbowed aside less forethoughtful seekers of divine wisdom. Clucking to the horses, Van steered after {{ him(eunuch) }}. Falfarun led the wagon into the sacred grove around the temple precinct. Seeing the Fox's success, the Trokmoi pulled off rings, armlets, and a heavy golden pectoral and waved them in the face of another plump {{ priest(eunuch) }}.
"You gauged the size of your second sack about right," Van whispered.
"Praise {{Dyaus}} for that! The last time I was here, I spent three days cooling my heels before I got to go before the {{Sibyl}}. I was still too young to know the world runs on gold."
"Was the {{ wench(Sibyl) }} worth looking at, once you finally saw {{ her(Sibyl) }}?"
"Scarcely. {{ She(Sibyl) }} was a wrinkled old crone. I wonder if {{ she(Sibyl) }} still lives."
"Why have {{ hag(Sibyl) }}s to give prophesies? It seems to me they'd hardly be fitting mates for whatever diety runs the shrine here. Give me a young, juicy {{ lass(Sibyl) }} every time," Van said, drawing a sniff from {{Elise}}.
"{{Biton}} has spoken through {{ her(Sibyl) }} since {{ she(Sibyl) }} was chosen for {{ him(Biton) }} when still a child," {{Gerin}} explained. "Whenever a {{Sibyl}} dies, the priests search among families of the old race; this valley has always been their stronghold. When they find a {{ girl(Sibyl) }}-child with a certain mark—what it is they keep secret, but it's been {{Biton}}'s sign for ages—{{ she(Sibyl) }} becomes the new {{Sibyl}} for as long as {{ she(Sibyl) }} remains a {{ virgin(Sibyl) }}: and {{ herd(Sibyl) }} chastity is guarded, I assure you."
<h3>* * *</h3>
The tumult behind them faded under the trees. Images of all-seeing {{Biton}} were everywhere in the grove, half of them turned to show the two eyes in the back of {{ hisd(Biton) }} head. Another {{ priest(eunuch) }} led the Trokmoi along a different path. Far from being struck by the holiness of the wood, they argued loudly in their own language.
High walls of gleaming white marble warded the outer courtyard of {{Biton}}'s temple. The gates were flung wide, but spear-carrying temple guards stood ready to slam them shut should trouble threaten. Here and there the shining stone was chipped and discolored, a mute reminder of the great invasion of the Trokmoi two hundred sixty years before, when {{Biton}} {{ himself(Biton) }}, the {{ priests(eunuch) }} maintained, made an appearance to drive the barbarians from {{ hisd(Biton) }} shrine.
Before they could go in, Falfarun summoned a green-robed under{{ priest(eunuch) }}. The fat {{ priest(eunuch) }} said, "It is not permitted to enter the courtyard save on foot; Arcarola here will take your wagon to its proper place. Fear not, for there is no theft on the grounds of the temple. A loathsome plague unfailingly smites any miscreant daring to attempt such rapine."
"How many are thus stricken?" {{Gerin}} asked skeptically.
"The body of the latest is one of the curiosities within the outer walls. Poor wretch; may {{ he(Van) }} edify others."
Sobered, {{Gerin}} descended from the wagon, followed by {{Elise}} and Van. When Arcarola climbed up, the horses rolled their eyes and tried to rear, feeling the unfamiliar touch at the reins. Van put a heavy hand on each one's muzzle and growled, "Don't you be stupid, now," following that with an oath in the harsh tongue {{Gerin}} guessed was {{ hisd(Van) }} own. The beasts subsided and let themselves be led away.
The Trokmoi came up about then. More green-robes took their chariots. The {{ priest(eunuch) }} who was leading them drew Falfarun aside and spoke softly with {{ him(eunuch) }}. The Trokmoi were talking too, and not softly: the argument they'd begun under the trees of the sacred grove was still in full swing. {{Gerin}} was about to greet them in their own tongue until {{ he(Gerin) }} heard what they were quarreling about.
One of the northerners looked suspiciously at the Fox and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} comrades. "Not so loud should you make it, Catuvolcis," {{ he(barbarian1) }} said. {{ He(barbarian1) }} sounded worried, and {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} scarred hands made hushing motions.
Catuvolcis was not going to be hushed. {{Gerin}} guessed {{ he(barbarian1) }} was a bit drunk. {{ Hisd(barbarian1) }} eyes were shot with red, {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} speech slurred. {{ He(barbarian1) }} toyed with {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} gruesome necklace. "Divici," {{ he(barbarian1) }} said, "you can take a flying futter at fast Fomor." {{ He(barbarian1) }} used the northern name for the quickest moon. "What's the chance we would find someone this far south who speaks the real language?"
"There's no need to take a chance for no purpose."
"But I'm saying it's no chance at all. And if you will remember, now, 'twas your scheme to come here. And what was the why of it? Just to have the privacy we could scarce be getting from our own oracles."
"A proper notion it was, too. I'd liefer not have that {{Balamung}} omadhaun know it's less than full faith I have in {{ him(Balamung) }}. Who is the spalpeen, anyhow, and why should we fight for {{ him(Balamung) }}? If I go hunting with a bear, why, I want to be sure the beast'll not save me for the main course."
Listening as hard as {{ he(Gerin) }} could without seeming to, {{Gerin}} barely noticed Falfarun return. {{ He(eunuch) }} was trailed by the other {{ priest(eunuch) }}, who was even fatter than {{ he(eunuch) }}. Falfarun coughed and said, "Good {{ sirm(Gerin) }}, my colleague Saspir"—{{ he(eunuch)}} indicated {{ hisd(eunuch) }} companion, whose smooth {{eunuch}}'s face belied the years shown by {{ hisd(eunuch) }} graying hair and sagging jowls—"and I have decided that these northern gentles should precede you to the {{Sibyl}}, as their journey has been longer than yours and they have urgent business in their own land which requires them to make haste."
"You are trying to tell me they paid you more," {{Gerin}} said without much rancor.
Falfarun's chins quivered. {{ Hisd(eunuch) }} voice was hurt as {{ he(eunuch) }} answered, "I would not put it so crassly—"
"—But it's still true," {{Gerin}} finished for {{ him(eunuch) }}. "Be it so, then, if we can follow them directly."
"But of course," Falfarun said, relieved to find {{ him(Gerin) }} so agreeable. Saspir gave the Trokmoi the good news and took them into the temple courtyard. Falfarun followed, {{ hisd(eunuch) }} reedy voice loud in the ears of {{Gerin}}, who would much rather have listened to the barbarians. Another golden-robed hierarch conducted a toga-clad noble out from the holy precinct; the {{ man(barbarian1) }}'s thin, pale face bore a troubled expression. The nomads from the plains of Shanda came up just as {{Gerin}} entered the courtyard. {{ He(Gerin) }} heard a {{ priest(eunuch) }} override their loud objections to being separated from their chariot.
Even the Trokmoi had fallen silent in the temple forecourt. They were gawking, necks craning every which way, trying to see everything at once. {{Gerin}} thought they looked like so many hungry hounds licking their chops in front of a butcher's shop. {{ He(Gerin) }} did not much blame them, for the sight of so much treasure affected {{ him(Gerin) }} the same way. The would-be thief's corpse, covered with hideous raw-edged lesions and bloated and stinking after some days in the open, did little to dampen {{ hisd(Gerin) }} enthusiasm. Beside {{ him(Gerin) }} Van whistled, soft and low.
Only the choicest gauds were on display. Most of the riches {{Biton}}'s shrine had accumulated over the centuries were stored away in strong-walled vaults behind the temple or in caves below it. What was visible was plenty to rouse a plunderer's lusts.
Chief among the marvels were twin ten-foot statues of gold and ivory, one of the {{Emperor}} Oren II, who had built the temple in the ancient grove, the other of {{ hisd(Emperor) }} {{ father(Emperor) }}, Ros the Fierce, who drove the Trokmoi north of the River Niffet and won the land between the Kirs and the Niffet for Elabon. Oren wore the toga and held in {{ hisd(Emperor) }} upraised right hand the orb of empire; Ros, mailed, had a javelin ready to cast and leaned upon a narrow-waisted shield of antique design.
Ros' stern craggy face, with its thrusting nose and lines carved deep on weathered cheeks, still brought awe after four hundred years. {{Gerin}} shivered when {{ he(Gerin) }} looked up into those cold eyes of jet.
A huge golden mixing bowl celebrated {{Biton}}'s triumph over the Trokmoi. Wider even than Van's outstretched arms, it was set upon a claw-footed tripod of bronze, and held the images of barbarians fleeing the {{ god(Biton) }}'s just wrath—and the prostrate bodies of those {{ hisd(Biton) }} arrows had struck down.
On a pedestal of purple marble next to it was a splendid statue of a dying Trokmê. The naked warrior was on {{ hisd(warrior1) }} right side, propping {{ himself(warrior1) }} up with {{ hisd(warrior1) }} right arm. That hand still clung to swordhilt. The other clutched a gaping gash in {{ hisd(warrior1) }} right side; the red-painted blood streamed down {{ hisd(warrior1) }} flank to form a puddle at {{ hisd(warrior1) }} hip. {{ Hisd(warrior1) }} face was turned up to stare at {{ hisd(warrior1) }} unportrayed conqueror. Its grimace showed agony and defiance, but not a hint of fear. The statue's features were blunter than those usual among the long-faced, thin-nosed Trokmoi. Probably the sculptor, {{ himself(warrior1) }} a Sithonian, had used a country{{man(warrior1)}} as model, adding only long hair and a full {{mustache(warrior1)}} to make clear the statue's race.
There was much else to see: the silver-and-gold longtooth, its leap onto an aurochs frozen by a master artisan of long ago; the chalices and urns of precious metals, alabaster, cinnabar, and multicolored jades; the stacks of ingots and bars of gold and silver, each with a plaque telling which accurate prophecy it commemorated . . . but Falfarun was leading {{Gerin}} up to the steps of the temple, and that was a sight in itself.
Oren's architect had tried to harmonize the sparsely elegant columned shrines the Sithonians loved with the native brickwork fanes of Elabon, and the effort was a noble one. The sides of {{Biton}}'s shrine were marble blocks; spacious glazed windows helped illuminate the interior. The front wall was pure Sithonian, with its triangular entablature supported by delicately fluted columns of whitest stone.
Between architrave and overhanging eaves the frieze, carved by a team of workmen from drawing by the creator of the dying Trokmê, showed {{Biton}}, hand outstretched, guiding an imperial column against a horde of Trokmoi. Ros, {{ hisd(Emperor) }} harsh features easy to recognize, stood in the lead chariot. {{ Hisd(Emperor) }} troops had a tough uniformity in striking contrast to the disorderly foe they battled—and to the nobles who had come after them.
Up the seven marble steps they went, Falfarun chattering all the while. When {{Elise}} heard statue and frieze sprang from the same artist’s mind, {{ she(Elise) }} asked the artist’s name. Falfarun looked shocked and shook {{ hisd(eunuch) }} head. "I have no idea," {{ he(eunuch) }} said. "The work is far too holy to be polluted by such mundanities."
{{Gerin}}'s eyes needed a moment to adjust to the inside of {{Biton}}'s shrine, accustomed as they were to bright sunshine. They went wide as {{ he(Gerin) }} saw the splendor within, for it had faded in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} memory.
Limiting {{ himself(Gerin) }} to simple white stone for the outside of the building, its designer had let color run riot within. Twin rows of crimson granite columns, polished mirror-bright, led the eye to the altar. That was of sandalwood overlain with gold and encrusted with all kinds of precious stone. It threw back in coruscating sheets the light cast on it by dozens of fat candles in three arabesqued chandeliers overhead.
The temple's inner walls were faced with rare green marbled shot with gold. That stone came from only one quarry, near Siphnos in Sithonia. The Fox could but marvel at the sweat and gold needed to haul it here, a journey of several hundred miles over the Greater Inner Sea and the royal roads of Elabon. Like the columns, it was buffed till it gleamed; it tinged niche-set gold and silver statues with its own color.
Chanting acolytes paced here and there, intent on {{Biton}}'s rituals. Their slippers swished over the floor mosaics, their swinging censers filled the air with the fragrances of aloes, myrrh, and other costly incenses. Folk who wanted {{Biton}}'s aid but needed no sight of the future knelt and prayed in pews flanking the granite columns. Some kept their heads lowered; others raised them to the ceiling frescoes, as if seeking inspiration from the scenes of the {{ god(Biton) }}'s begetting by {{Dyaus}} on a {{ princess-opp(Dyaus) }} and of {{ hisd(Biton) }} subsequent adventures, most of them caused by the jealousy of the heavenly {{ queen(Darza) }} {{Darza}}.
Only in two respects was {{Biton}}'s shrine unlike many even more superb temples in the lands south of the mountains. One was the image of the {{ god(Biton) }} behind the altar. Here {{ he(Biton) }} was no graceful {{ youth(Biton) }}. A square column of rough black stone stood there, drinking in the light and giving back none. Immeasurably old, it could have been a natural pillar, save for the faint images of eyes round its top and a jutting phallus stabbing forward from its middle.
{{Biton}}'s {{ priests(eunuch) }} had only smiled when Oren proclaimed their deity a {{ son(Biton) }} of {{Dyaus}}. In their hearts they knew whose {{ god(Biton) }} was the elder. Seeing that image, {{Gerin}} was not inclined to doubt them. {{Biton}}'s power was rooted in the earth, and in the square of bare earth to the left of the altar was a rift leading down below the roots of the sacred grove to the {{Sibyl}}'s cave, a rift whose like was unknown in the tamer south.
The Trokmoi made obeisance before {{Biton}}'s altar, the three chieftains on their knees and the drivers flat on their bellies. They rose, dusted themselves off, and followed their guide into the yawning mouth of the cave. One driver, a freckled {{ youth(barbarian1) }} with face tight-set against fear, flexed the fingers of one hand in a sign to avert evil. The other was tight on the hilt of {{ hisd(Divico) }} blade.
Falfarun brought up {{ hisd(eunuch) }} charges to take the barbarians' place. All bent the knee before {{Biton}}, Falfarun panting as {{ he(eunuch) }} eased {{ hisd(eunuch) }} bulk to the floor. {{Gerin}} looked up at the ancient idol. For an instant, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought {{ he(Gerin) }} saw eyes brown as {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own looking back at {{ him(Gerin) }}, but when {{ he(Gerin) }} looked again they were only scratches on stone.
Rising, Falfarun asked, "Would it please you to take more comfortable seats while waiting to meet the {{Sibyl}}?"
{{Gerin}} sat in the foremost pew. {{ He(Gerin) }} ignored the puffing Falfarun, who dabbed at {{ hisd(eunuch) }} forehead with a square of blue silk. {{ hisd(Gerin) }} thoughts were on the Trokmoi: if these barbarians, {{ men(barbarian1) }} from so deep in the forests {{ he(Gerin) }} knew nothing of them, had allied their clans with {{Balamung}}, how many more had done the same? Fox Keep, it seemed, was in the way of an onsalught more terrible than the attack whose scars still showed on the temple forecourt's walls.
{{ He(Gerin) }} grew more and more jittery until the Trokmoi emerged from the cavemouth. All were grim-faced: they had no liking for what they'd heard. The young driver who had made the wardsign was white as an exterior column, the freckles on {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} nose and cheeks standing out like spatters of dried blood.
The two chiefs who had been quarreling outside the temple forecourt were still at it. {{Divico}}, even more worried than before, waved a hand in front of Catuvolcus' face. "Are you not glad now we came?" {{ he(Divico) }} said. "Plain as day the {{ witch(Sibyl) }}-woman told us there'd be naught but a fox gnawing our middles if we joined {{Balamung}}, plain as day."
"Ox ordure," Catuvolcus said. "The old gammer has no more wits than teeth, the count of which is none. On all the border there's but one southron called the Fox, and were you not listening when {{ himself(Balamung) }} told us the kern'd be ravens' meat in no more than days? It must be done by now, so where's your worry?"
{{Gerin}} stood and gave the Trokmoi {{ hisd(Gerin) }} politest bow. "Begging your pardon," {{ he(Gerin) }} said, using their tongue with a borderer's ease, "but a {{ wizard(Balamung) }}'s word a coin I'd bite or ever I pocketed it. But if you're after the Fox, I am {{ he(Gerin) }}, and I tell you this: the raven who'll pick my bones is not yet hatched, no, nor {{ hisd(Balamung) }} grandsire either."
{{ He(Gerin) }} had hoped {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sudden appearance would show the barbarians the folly of their way. Instead {{ he(Gerin) }} saw the rashness of {{ hisd(Gerin) }}, for Catuvolcus bellowed an oath, grasped sword from scabbard, and rushed. {{ Hisd(barbarian1) }} five comrades followed.
Leaping to {{ hisd(Van) }} feet, Van lifted Falfarun over {{ hisd(Van) }} head as easily as if the fat {{eunuch}} had been stuffed with down. {{ He(Van) }} pitched {{ him(Van) }} into the Trokmoi, bowling over two of them and giving {{ himself(Van) }} and {{Gerin}} time to free their blades. At the same instant {{Elise}} hurled a dagger, then skipped back to safety. The freckled driver fell, throat pumping a torrent of blood round the hilt suddenly flowering there and sword slipping from nerveless fingers.
Catuvolcus ducked under the hurtling {{ priest(eunuch) }}. {{ He(barbarian1) }} swung up {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} sword two-handed, brought it down in a cut to cleave {{Gerin}} from crown to chin. Sparks flew as the Fox blocked the stroke. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} arms felt numb to the elbow. {{ He(Gerin) }} ducked under another wild slash, edged bronze whizzing bare inches above {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head.
{{ hisd(Gerin) }} own sword bit into the Trokmê's belly. {{ He(Gerin) }} ripped it free to parry the lunge of one of the drivers. The northerner seemed confused at facing a left handed swords{{ man(Gerin) }}. {{Gerin}} beat down another tentative thrust, feinted at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} enemy's throat, and guided {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sword into the barbarian's heart. More surprise than pain on {{ hisd(Divico) }} face, the Trokmê swayed and fell. {{ He(Divico) }} gasped for air {{ he(Divico) }} could not breathe, tried to speak. Only blood gushed from between {{ hisd(Divico) }} lips.
The Fox looked round for more fight, but there was none. Van leaned on {{ hisd(Van) }} blade and puffed; {{ he(Van) }} watched the shrilling, scrambling {{eunuch}}s with distaste. Half the proud crest of {{ hisd(Van) }} helm was sheared away. {{ Hisd(Van) }} armor was drenched with gore, but none was {{ hisd(Van) }}. Red hair matted by redder blood, the head of one barbarian stared glassily at its body. The ghastly corpse lay across another, whose entrails and pouring blood befouled the gentle meadow of the mosaic floor.
Horror on {{ herd(Elise) }} face, {{Elise}} came up to survey the carnage. With a flourish, Van plucked {{ herd(Elise) }} dagger from its victim's throat and handed {{ her(Elise) }} the dripping weapon. "As fine a throw as I've ever seen, and as timely, too," {{ he(Van) }} said. {{ She(Elise) }} held it a moment, then threw it to the floor as hard as {{ she(Elise) }} could and gagged, reeling back against the pews.
{{Gerin}} put a hand on {{ herd(Elise) }} shoulder to comfort {{ her(Elise) }}. {{ She(Elise) }} clung to {{ him(Gerin) }} and sobbed. {{ He(Gerin) }} murmured wordless reassurance. {{ He(Gerin) }} was nearly as much an accidental warrior as was {{ she(Elise) }}, and recalled only too well puking up {{ hisd(Gerin) }} guts in a clump of bushes after {{ hisd(Gerin) }} first kill. Now {{ he(Gerin) }} was just glad {{ he(Gerin) }} was still among the living, and tried not to think of the ruined humanity at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} feet.
{{ He(Gerin) }} offered {{ hisd(Gerin) }} canteen to {{Elise}} so {{ she(Elise) }} could rinse {{ herd(Elise) }} mouth. {{ She(Elise) }} took it with a muffled word of thanks.
A squad of temple guards rushed down the main aisle, brushing aside the plainsfolk (who had watched the fight with interest) and their guide. The guard captain, {{ hisd(Etchebar) }} corselet gilded to show {{ hisd(captain) }} rank, shook {{ hisd(captain) }} head when {{ he(Etchebar) }} heard {{Gerin}}'s story, though Saspir confirmed it. Tugging {{ hisd(Etchebar) }} {{ beard2m(Etchebar) }}, the officer, whose name was {{Etchebar}}, said, "To slay a {{ priest(eunuch) }} of the {{ god(Biton) }}, even to save your own lives, is foully done. Surprised am I {{Biton}} did not smite you dead."
"Slay?" Van shouted. "Who in the five hells said anything about slaying a {{ priest(eunuch) }}, you jouncebrained lump of dung?" {{Etchebar}}'s spearmen bristled at that, but restrained themselves at {{ hisd(Etchebar) }} gesture. "The great tun is no more slain than you, as you'd find out if you flipped water in {{ hisd(eunuch) }} fat face. And if we'd waited for your aid, it'd be the Trokmoi you were jabbering with here!" {{ He(Van) }} spat into the pool of red. "Look!"
As smoothly as before, {{ he(Van) }} lifted Falfarun. The {{ priest(eunuch) }} had still been on top of the inert {{Divico}}. Van set {{ him(eunuch) }} on {{ hisd(eunuch) }} feet as blood dribbled from the hem of {{ hisd(eunuch) }} robe. The outlander slapped {{ him(eunuch) }} gently, once or twice. {{ He(eunuch) }} groaned and clutched {{ hisd(eunuch) }} head. {{ He(eunuch) }} did not seem much hurt, however shaken {{ he(eunuch) }} was.
{{Gerin}} turned all {{ hisd(Gerin) }} powers of persuasion on the guard captain and the {{ priest(eunuch) }}, one of whose eyes was already beginning to blacken. {{ He(Gerin) }} broke off in mid-sentence when {{ he(Gerin) }} saw Van stooping over {{Divico}}, plainly intending to finish off the unconscious {{ man(Divico) }}. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} made a quick grab for {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend's arm.
"Captain, are you daft?" Van said.
"I hope not." {{Gerin}} took Van's place over the fallen Trokmê and shook {{ him(Divico) }}.
* * *
{{Divico}} came to {{ himself(Divico) }} with a thunderstorm in {{ hisd(Divico) }} head. {{ He(Divico) }} moaned and opened {{ hisd(Divico) }} eyes. That accursed Fox was bending over {{ him(Divico) }}, the scar above {{ hisd(Divico) }} eye white against {{ hisd(Divico) }} tan, {{ hisd(Divico) }} square face hard. The Trokmê gathered {{ himself(Divico) }} for a spring until {{ he(Divico) }} felt the cold kiss of a blade at {{ hisd(Divico) }} throat. {{ He(Divico) }} rolled {{ hisd(Divico) }} eyes down until {{ he(Divico) }} saw its upper edge, still smeared with blood.
Impotent rage flashed across {{ hisd(Divico) }} face. "I willna beg for my life, if it's that you're after," {{ he(Divico) }} said. "Slit my weasand and have done."
"A warrior's answer," {{Gerin}} nodded, still speaking the forest tongue with a fluency {{Divico}} found damnable. "Can it be you're wise as well?"
{{ He(Gerin) }} sheathed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sword and helped the bewildered Trokmê sit. The chieftain hissed when {{ he(Divico) }} saw {{ hisd(Divico) }} slaughtered comrades.
{{Gerin}} waved at them and went on, "You and your friends heard the {{Sibyl}}'s words, but did they heed them? Not a bit, and see what's become of them now. Sure as sure the same'll befall you and your clansmen if you go following {{Balamung}}'s war-trumpets. If I give you your life, would you go and tell them that, aye, and others you meet on the way?"
{{Divico}}'s red brows came together as {{ he(Divico) }} thought. At last {{ he(Divico) }} said, "I would that. For Catuvolcus and Arviragus I cared not a fart. Poor Togail is another matter, though. Black shame 'twill be to me to tell my {{ brother(barbarian1) }} Kell {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} {{ son(barbarian2) }} had {{ hisd(barbarian2) }} lovely throat torn out while I return revengeless. Still, I will do it, to keep the same from befalling all my kin. Fox, I like you not, but I will. By Taranis, Teutates, and Esus I swear it."
That was the strongest oath the Trokmoi knew, {{Gerin}} thought; if it would not bind {{Divico}} to {{ hisd(Divico) }} word, nothing would. "Good {{ man(Divico) }}!" {{ he(Gerin) }} said, clasping {{ hisd(Divico) }} hand and helping {{ him(Divico) }} to {{ hisd(Divico) }} feet. {{ He(Gerin) }} almost told the Trokmê {{ he(Gerin) }} thought like an Elabonian, but judged the proud chieftain would think it an insult.
"A moment," {{Etchebar}} said drily. "You have not the only claim on this {{ man(Divico) }}. Because of {{ him(Divico) }}, blood was shed in the holy precinct, which is abhorrent to our {{ lord(Biton) }} {{Biton}}." {{ He(Etchebar) }} touched {{ hisd(Etchebar) }} eyes and the back of {{ hisd(Etchebar) }} head in reverence. Falfarun nodded vigorous agreement. The guards leveled their spears at {{Divico}}, who shrugged and relaxed but kept {{ hisd(Divico) }} hand near {{ hisd(Divico) }} sword.
"I am sure we can come to an understanding," {{Gerin}} said, propelling guard captain and {{ priest(eunuch) }} into a quiet corner. There they argued for some minutes. The Fox reminded them that {{Divico}} had opposed Catuvolcus, who started the unholy combat. Furthermore, {{ he(Gerin) }} pointed out, {{Biton}} was able to deal with those who offended {{ him(Biton) }}, as {{ he(Biton) }} had proved on the body of the luckless thief who was displayed in the forecourt.
{{Etchebar}} growled a curt order and {{Divico}} was set free. The Trokmê bowed to {{Gerin}} and left, one hand still clutched to {{ hisd(Divico) }} aching skull.
Another discreet offering of gold "for the temple" salved Falfarun's bruises. {{Etchebar}} was a harder case, for Van's chaffing had wounded {{ hisd(Etchebar) }} pride. {{ He(Etchebar) }} wanted satisfaction, not gold. Making sure the outlander was not in earshot, {{Gerin}} apologized profusely.
Black-robed temple servitors dragged away the dead Trokmoi and began to mop up their spilled gore, which had already attracted a few flies. Eyes still unhappy under bushy eyebrows, {{Etchebar}} gathered up {{ hisd(Etchebar) }} soldiers and led them back to the forecourt. "And now, gentles, to the {{Sibyl}} at last," Falfarun said, with quite as much solemn aplomb as {{ he(eunuch) }} had had before {{ he(eunuch) }} was tossed about and {{ hisd(eunuch) }} gleaming robe befouled.
The mouth to the {{Sibyl}}'s cave was a black, grinning slit. {{Elise}}, still wan, took {{Gerin}}'s hand. Looking down into the inky unknown, {{ he(Gerin) }} was glad of the touch. Van fumed blasphemously as {{ he(Van) }} tried to scrub sticky drying blood from {{ hisd(Van) }} cuirass.
Falfarun vanished down the cavemouth. "You need have no fear for your footing," {{ he(eunuch) }} called. "Since the unhappy day a century ago when the cousin of the {{Emperor}} Forenz (the second of that name, I believe) tumbled and broke an ankle, it was thought wise to construct regular steps and flooring to replace rocks and dirt. Such is life." {{ He(eunuch) }} sighed, a bit unhappy at tradition flouted.
The subterranean corridor to the {{Sibyl}}'s cave went down and down, twisting until {{Gerin}} lost all idea of which way {{ he(Gerin) }} was going. A few dim candles set in brackets of immemorial antiquity gave pale and fitful light, making the flapping shadow of Falfarun's robe a monstrous thing. Cross-branches of the caverns were holes of deeper blackness in the gloom. {{Elise}}'s grip on {{Gerin}}'s hand tightened.
Most of the cave wall was left in its natural state. Now and again a bit of rock crystal would gleam for a moment in the candlelight and then fade. A few stretches were walled off by brickwork of a most antique mode which had its origins in the timeworn river land of Kizzuwatna, where people first lived in cities: not truly square like most bricks, these had convex tops and looked like buns of baked earth.
When {{Gerin}} asked the reason for the brickwork, Falfarun answered with a shiver, "Behind the bricks are charms of great fellness, for not all branches of these caves are safe. As you have seen, some we use for armories, others to store grain or treasure. But in some branches dread things dwell, and those who tried to explore them never returned. Those ways were stopped, as you see, to prevent such tragedies. More than that I cannot tell you, for it was done ages ago."
Imagining the pallid monsters that could inhabit such dismal gloom, {{Gerin}} shivered {{ himself(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} tried not to think of the tons of rock and earth over {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. Van muttered something that might have been prayer or curse and hitched the swordbelt higher on {{ hisd(Van) }} hip.
An ancient statue of {{Biton}} smiled its secret smile at them as they neared the {{Sibyl}}. The candles gave way to brighter torches. The corridor widened to form a small chamber. A gust of cool, damp wind blew past {{Gerin}}'s face. {{ He(Gerin) }} heard the deep mutter of a great subterranean river far below.
When Falfarun touched {{ hisd(Gerin) }} elbow, {{ he(Gerin) }} started. "Your gifts entitle you to privacy with the {{Sibyl}}, if such is your desire," the {{ priest(eunuch) }} said.
{{Gerin}} thought, then nodded.
Surprisingly, Falfarun's bruised face crinkled into a half-smile. "Good," {{ he(eunuch) }} said. "Did the answer you received please you not, belike your brawny friend would undertake to pitch me through a wall." Van sputtered in embarrassment. Falfarun went on, "Good fortune attend you, gentles, and I leave you with the {{Sibyl}}." {{ He(eunuch) }} waved at the throne set against the rear wall of the chamber and was gone.
"By my sword," Van said softly, "if I didn't know better, I'd say it was carved from one black pearl." Taller than a man, the high seat glimmered nacreously in the torchlight; crowns of silver shone on its two back posts.
The throne's splendor made the bundle of rags sitting on it altogether incongruous. Though the Trokmoi had called the {{Sibyl}} a crone, {{Gerin}} hadn't been able to believe the withered body through which the {{ god(Biton) }} had spoken ten years before still held life. But it was {{ she(Sibyl) }}, one eye dim, the other whitened by cataract. {{ Herd(Sibyl) }} face was a badlands of wrinkles; {{ herd(Sibyl) }} scalp shone through thinning strands of yellowish hair.
The mind behind that ruined countenance was still sharp, though. {{ She(Sibyl) }} raised one withered claw in a gesture of command. "Step forward, {{ lass(Elise) }}, {{ lad(Gerin)}}s," {{ she(Sibyl) }} said, voice a dry rustle. {{Gerin}} knew {{ she(Sibyl) }} would have called {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ father(Duren) }} "{{ lad(Duren)}}" had {{ he(Duren) }} been before {{ her(Sibyl) }}, and {{ she(Sibyl) }} would have been as right.
"What would you know of my {{ master(Biton) }} {{Biton}}?" {{ she(Sibyl) }} asked.
For some days {{Gerin}} had mulled the question {{ he(Gerin) }} would put. Still, in that place {{ hisd(Gerin) }} tongue stumbled as {{ he(Gerin) }} asked, "How best may I save myself and my lands and destroy the {{ wizard(Balamung) }} who threatens them?"
{{ She(Sibyl) }} did not reply at once. Thinking {{ she(Sibyl) }} had not heard, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} opened {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mouth to ask the question again. But with no warning, {{ herd(Sibyl) }} eyes rolled back, showing only vein-tracked whites. {{ Herd(Sibyl) }} scrawny fists clenched; {{ herd(Sibyl) }} body shook and trembled, throwing {{ herd(Sibyl) }} robe off one dry shoulder to reveal an empty dug. {{ Herd(Sibyl) }} face twisted. When {{ she(Sibyl) }} spoke, it was not in {{ herd(Sibyl) }} own voice, but that of a powerful {{ man(Biton) }} in the first flush of strength. Hearing the {{ god(Biton) }}, {{Gerin}} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} companions went to their knees as {{ hisd(Biton) }} words washed over them:
"Buildings fall in flame and fire:
Against you even gods conspire.
Bow before the mage of the north
When all {{ hisd(Balamung) }} power is put forth
To crush you down, to lay you low:
For {{ hisd(Balamung) }} grave no {{ man(person) }}l will know."
The {{ god(Biton) }}'s voice and power gone, the {{Sibyl}} slumped forward in a faint.
V
Evening came. Gray clouds scudded across the sky. The wet-dust smell of rain was in the air. Grim and silent, {{Gerin}} began to help Van make camp. {{Elise}}, worry in {{ herd(Elise) }} voice and on {{ herd(Elise) }} face, said, "Not three words have you spoken since we left the temple."
All the rage and helplessness the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had contained since {{ he(Gerin) }} stalked frozen-faced past Falfarun to reclaim the wagon came out in a torrent of bile. {{ He(Gerin) }} slammed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} helmet to the ground. It spun into the undergrowth. "What difference does it make?" {{ he(Gerin) }} said bitterly. "I might as well cut my own throat and save that perambulating corpse the work. The {{Sibyl}} told me the same thing {{ he(Balamung) }} did, only from {{ him(Balamung) }} I hadn't believed it. I was a fool to go to {{ her(Sibyl) }}; I wanted advice, not a death sentence. A plague take all oracles!"
At that, Van looked up. While {{Gerin}} stormed, {{ he(Van) }} had quietly gone on setting up camp. {{ He(Van) }}'d started a fire and drained the blood of a purchased fowl into a trench to propitiate the ghosts. "I knew a {{ man(Gerin) }} who said something like that once, captain," {{ he(Van) }} said.
"Is there a story to go with the knowing?" {{Elise}} asked, seemingly searching for any way to draw {{Gerin}} out of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} inner darkness.
"Aye, that there is," Van agreed. {{ He(Van) }} understood well enough what {{ she(Elise) }} was after, and pitched {{ hisd(Van) }} words to the Fox. {{Elise}} settled {{ herself(Elise) }} by the fire to listen. "Captain, you know—or you've heard me say—the world is round, no matter what any {{ priest(eunuch) }} may blabber. I know. I should; I've been round it.
"Maybe ten years ago, when I was at the far eastern edge of this continent, I hired on as a {{ man(Van) }}-at-arms under a merchant named {{Zairin}}. {{ He(Zairin) }} was moving a shipment of jade, silk, and spices from a place called Ban Yarang to Selat, a couple of hundred miles southeastward. The folk are funny round those parts, little yellow-skins with slanting eyes like the Shanda nomads'. It looks better on the women, I must say. Still, that's no part of the yarn.
"{{Zairin}} was one of those people who have no truck with the gods. Now, in those parts it's customary to check the omens by watching the way the sacred peacocks peck at grain. If they eat well, the journey will be a good one. If not, it's thought wiser to try again some other time.
"There we were, all ready to set out, and {{Zairin}}'s right-hand {{ man(Tzem) }}—a fat little {{ fellow(Tzem) }} named {{Tzem}}—brought us a bird from the shrine. {{ He(Tzem) }} poured out the grain, but the peacock, who probably hadn't much liked traveling slung under {{ hisd(Tzem) }} arm for more than a mile, just looked at it. He wouldn't touch it for anything, not that bird.
"{{Zairin}} sat watching this, getting madder and madder. Finally the old bandit had {{ himself(Zairin) }} a gutful. {{ He(Zairin) }} got up on {{ hisd(Zairin) }} feet and roared out, 'If he won't eat, let him drink!' May my {{ beard(Zairin) }} fall out if I lie, {{ he(Zairin) }} picked up that peacock, chucked it into the Kemlong river (which runs through Ban Yarang) and started off regardless."
{{Gerin}} was caught up in spite of {{ himself(Gerin) }}. "{{Dyaus}}! It's not a chance I'd like to take," {{ he(Gerin) }} said.
"And you the {{ fellow(Gerin) }} who curses oracles? You can imagine what we were thinking. Most of the way, though, things went well enough. The road was only a little track through the thickest jungle I've ever seen, so we lost a couple of porters to venomous snakes the poor barefoot fools stepped on, and one more to a blood-sucking demon that left {{ him(retainer1) }} no more than a withered husk when we found {{ him(retainer1) }} the next morning. But on a trip like that, you learn to expect such things. {{Zairin}} was mightily pleased with {{ himself(Zairin) }}. {{ He(Zairin) }} kept laughing and telling anyone who'd listen what a lot of twaddle it was to pay any attention to a fool bird.
"Well, a day and a half before we would have made Selat and proved the old croaker right, everything came unraveled at once. A dam broke upstream from where we were fording; five people and half our donkeys drowned. The customs {{ man(customs) }} {{Zairin}} knew at the border had been transferred, and I shudder to think of the silver {{ hisd(customs) }} replacement gouged out of us. Half the company got a bloody flux. It bothered me for two years. And just to top everything off, old {{Zairin}} came down with the crabs. From then on, captain, {{ he(Zairin) }} was a believer, I can tell you!"
"Go howl!" {{Gerin}} said. "I was hoping you'd cheer me with a yarn where a prophesy turned out wrong. I know enough of the other sort myself. For that you can stand first watch."
"Can I, now? Well, you can—" The outlander scorched {{Gerin}} in more tongues than the Fox knew. Finally {{ he(Van) }} said, "Captain, fair is fair: I'll wrestle you for it."
"Aren't you the bloodthirsty one? I thought you'd had enough fighting for one day."
{{Gerin}} got up and pulled off {{ hisd(Gerin) }} over tunic. {{ He(Gerin) }} helped Van undo the leather laces of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} back-and-breast. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} friend sighed as the weight came off. In kilt and sandals, Van seemed more a war-{{ god(Van) }} than ever. {{ Hisd(Van) }} muscles rippled as {{ he(Van) }} stretched. The forest of golden hair on {{ hisd(Van) }} body flashed in the firelight. Only {{ hisd(Van) }} scars told of {{ hisd(Van) }} humanity—and {{ hisd(Van) }} turbulent past. One terrible gash ran from right armpit to hip; every time {{Gerin}} saw it, {{ he(Gerin) }} wondered how the outlander had lived.
Not that {{ he(Gerin) }} was unmarked {{ himself(Gerin) }}: sword, spear, knife, and arrow had left their signatures on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} skin, and the cut {{Aingus}} had given {{ him(Gerin) }} was only half healed. Seeing {{Elise}}'s eyes travel from Van's enormous frame to {{ him(Gerin) }}, {{ he(Gerin) }} knew {{ he(Gerin) }} seemed a stripling beside {{ hisd(Gerin) }} companion, though {{ he(Gerin) }} was a well-made {{ man(Gerin) }} of good size.
But {{ he(Gerin) }} had a name as a wrestler on both sides of the Niffet. {{ He(Gerin) }} had learned more tricks from masters south of the Kirs than {{ hisd(Gerin) }} neighbors ever imagined, and threw {{ men(Gerin) }} much bigger than {{ himself(Gerin) }}. For all that, though, Van's raw strength was enough to flatten {{ him(Gerin) }} as often as {{ he(Gerin) }} could finesse {{ hisd(Gerin) }} way to victory. When word went out that they would tussle, even Trokmoi came to watch and bet.
Embarrassed that {{ herd(Elise) }} look had been seen and understood, {{Elise}} dropped {{ herd(Elise) }} eyes. {{Gerin}} grinned at {{ her(Elise) }}. "{{ He(Van) }} won't chuck me through a tree, {{ girl(Elise) }}."
"Who says I won't?" Van bellowed. {{ He(Van) }} charged like an avalanche. {{Gerin}} sprang to meet {{ him(Van) }}. Ducking under the thick arms that would quickly have squeezed breath from {{ him(Gerin) }}, {{ he(Gerin) }} hooked {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own left arm behind Van's right knee and rammed a shoulder into {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend's hard-muscled middle.
Van grunted and went down, but a meaty paw dragged {{Gerin}} after {{ him(Van) }}. They rolled, thrashed, and grappled in the dirt. {{Gerin}} ended up riding {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend's broad back. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} hands had slid under the outlander's shoulders; {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hands were clasped behind Van's neck. Van slapped the ground. {{Gerin}} let {{ him(Van) }} up. {{ He(Gerin) }} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head and rubbed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eye to rout out some dust.
"You'll have to show me that one again, {{Gerin}}," {{ he(Van) }} said. "Another fall?"
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} shrugged. "All right, but the last one was for the watch." Van nodded. In mid-nod, {{ he(Van) }} leaped. {{Gerin}} had no chance to use any of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} feints or traps. {{ He(Gerin) }} was seized, lifted, and slammed to earth with rib-jarring force. Van sprang on {{ him(Gerin) }} like a starving lion onto a fat sheep.
Thoroughly pinned, {{Gerin}} grumbled, "Get off me, you pile of suet!" Van snorted and pulled {{ him(Gerin) }} to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} feet. They both swore as they swabbed each other's scratches with beer-soaked rags. The stuff stung foully.
After supper, {{Gerin}} began to regret not having the first watch. {{ He(Gerin) }} was sure {{ he(Gerin) }} was too full of troubles to sleep, despite the day's exertions. {{ He(Gerin) }} tossed, wriggled until a small stone no longed gouged {{ hisd(Gerin) }} back, wished the crickets were not so loud. . . .
Van watched {{ hisd(Van) }} friend's face relax as slumber overtook {{ him(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Van) }} was not too worried about the {{ baron(Gerin) }}'s dejection; {{ he(Van) }} had seen {{ him(Gerin) }} downhearted before, and knew {{ he(Gerin) }} recovered quickly. But the Fox deeply felt {{ hisd(Gerin) }} responsibilities. If anything, a menace to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} lands hit {{ him(Gerin) }} harder than a threat against {{ himself(Gerin) }}.
More and more clouds blew in from the west, pale against the dark blue dome of the sky. Math, a day past first quarter, and mottled Tiwaz, now nearly full, jumped in and out of sight. A couple of hours before midnight, dim Nothos' waning gibbous disk joined them. The wind carried a faint salt tang from the Orynian Ocean far away. Van scrubbed dried blood from {{ hisd(Van) }} armor and helm, waiting till it was time to wake {{Gerin}}.
Rain threatened all through the Fox's watch. It was still dark when the first spatters came. {{Elise}} jerked as a drop splashed {{ herd(Elise) }} cheek; {{ she(Elise) }} woke up all at once, like a soldier. Smiling at {{Gerin}}, {{ she(Elise) }} said, " 'The gods in the heaven send dripping-tressed rain/ To nourish sweet hope in a desert of pain'—or so the poet says, anyway."
{{ He(Gerin) }} stared at {{ her(Elise) }}. The passage of a night had eased much of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} gloom; now surprise banished the rest. "Where did you learn to quote Lekapenos? And whose rendering was that? Whoever did it knows {{ hisd(Gerin) }} Sithonian well."
"As for the rendering—" {{ She(Elise) }} shrugged. "It's mine. That passage always appealed to me. And where else would I learn my letters than from the epics?"
That held much truth. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} still recalled the godlike feeling {{ he(Gerin) }}'d had when the curious marks on parchment began to correspond with the verses {{ he(Gerin) }}'d learned by ear. Thoughtfully, {{ he(Gerin) }} started getting ready to travel again.
* * *
{{Gerin}} was glad to exchange the dirt road that led to Ikos for the main southbound highway before the former became a bottomless river of mud. Moments later, {{ he(Gerin) }} was wondering at the wisdom of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} choice. From behind {{ him(Gerin) }} came a drumming of hooves, the deadly clangor of bronze on bronze, and wheels rumbling on a stone roadbed—a squadron of chariotry, moving fast.
Van unshipped {{ hisd(Van) }} spear and {{Gerin}} began to string {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bow. Then a deep voice sounded above the rising clatter: "Way! Way for the company of {{Aragis}} the Archer!"
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} pulled off the road with almost unseemly haste. Ignoring the rain, Aragis' troopers pounded past, brave in surcoats of scarlet and silver. A handful of draggled bandits were their reluctant companions.
Proud hawk face never smiling, Aragis' captain—or maybe it was {{Aragis}} {{ himself(Aragis) }}—raised one arm in salute as {{ hisd(Aragis) }} company thundered by. Some of them had leers for {{Elise}}, stares for Van's fine cuirass. The bandits looked stolidly ahead. {{Gerin}} guessed they could already see the headsman's axe looming large across their futures, and precious little else.
"Whew!" Van said as the chariots disappeared into the rain ahead. "This trip will make a fine yarn, but it's not something I'd like to do more than once."
"Which is true of most things that make good stories," {{Gerin}} said. Van laughed and nodded.
From Ikos to Cassat was a journey of two days. To the {{ baron(Gerin) }}, they were a time of revelation. For years {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind had not reached further than the harvest, the balance of a blade, or the best place to set an ambush. But {{Elise}} had read many of the works that were {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own favorites and, better yet, thought on what {{ she(Elise) }} read. They passed hour after hour quoting passages they liked and arguing meanings.
{{Gerin}} had almost forgotten talk like this existed. Over the years, all without {{ hisd(Gerin) }} knowing it, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind had grown stuffy and stale. Now {{ he(Gerin) }} relished the fresh new breeze playing through it.
Van chimed in too, from time to time. {{ He(Van) }} lacked the background {{Gerin}} and {{Elise}} shared, but {{ he(Van) }} had seen more of the varied ways of man than either, and {{ hisd(Van) }} wit was keen.
The purple bulk of the High Kirs, a great rampart looming tall on the southern horizon, came to dominate the landscape. Eternal snow clung to many peaks, scoffing at high summer below. Eight passes traversed the mountains; seven the Empire had painstakingly blocked over the years, to keep out the northern barbarians. In the foothills before the eighth squatted the town of Cassat, a monument to what might have been.
Oren II had planned it as a splendid capital for the new province {{ hisd(Emperor) }} {{ father(Emperor) }} had won. Its great central square was filled with temples, triumphal arches, law courts, and a theater. But fate had not been kind. Birds nested under the eaves of the noble buildings; grass pushed up between marble paving-blocks. The only reality to Cassat was its barracks, squat, unlovely structures of wood and grimy plaster where a few hundred imperial soldiers pretended to rule the northlands. A few streets of horsetraders, swordsmiths, joyhouses, and taverns met their needs. The dusty wind blew mournful through the rest of the town.
The Empire's dragon flag, black on gold, flew only over the barracks. There did {{Carus}} Beo's {{ son(Carus) }}, the Marchwarden of the North, perform {{ hisd(Carus) }} office; mice alone disputed in the courthouse Oren had built.
Once, {{Carus}} had been a favorite at court. {{ He(Carus) }} had earned {{ hisd(Carus) }} present post some years back, when the Urfa massacred a column {{ he(Carus) }} led. Because of what {{ he(Carus) }} saw as exile to the cheerless north, {{ he(Carus) }} despised and resented the border barons.
{{Gerin}} called on {{ him(Carus) }} nonetheless. Few as they were, Carus' troops would help hold the border against the Trokmoi, could {{ he(Carus) }} be persuaded to send them north. {{Elise}} accompanied the {{ baron(Gerin) }}. Van took the wagon to a leading trader of horseflesh, seeking fresh animals to replace {{Gerin}}'s weary beasts.
The Marchwarden of the North sat at a well-scuffed desk piled high with parchments of all sizes. {{ He(Carus) }} was sixty or a bit over; {{ hisd(Carus) }} yellowish-white hair had retreated to a ruff round {{ hisd(Carus) }} ears and the back of {{ hisd(Carus) }} neck, leaving {{ hisd(Carus) }} pink scalp bare but for a meager forelock. {{ Hisd(Carus) }} eyes had dark pockets under them.
{{ Hisd(Carus) }} jowls quivered when {{ he(Carus) }} lifted {{ hisd(Carus) }} head from whatever bureaucratic inconsequentiality {{Gerin}}'s arrival had interrupted.
"My {{ man(retainer1) }} tells me you seek the assistance of the Empire against the Trokmoi. Surely the boldness of the brave holders of Elabon's frontier cannot have declined to such an abysmal level?" {{ he(Carus) }} said, looking at {{Gerin}} with no liking at all.
Then {{ hisd(Carus) }} narrow eyes swiveled to {{Elise}}, and a murky gleam lit them. The Fox saw a liking there, sure enough, but only of the sort that made {{ him(Gerin) }} want to kick the {{Carus}}’ stained teeth down {{ hisd(Carus) }} throat. {{Elise}} studied a point on the wall directly behind the Marchwarden's forehead.
"Surely not," {{Gerin}} said. Ignoring the fact that {{ he(Gerin) }} had not been offered a seat, {{ he(Gerin) }} handed {{Elise}} into a chair and took another for {{ himself(Gerin) }}. {{Carus}}' sallow cheeks reddened. As if nothing had happened, the Fox resumed, "At the present time, however, circumstances are of unusual difficulty." {{ He(Gerin) }} told the Marchwarden of {{Balamung}} and {{ hisd(Balamung) }} threatened invasion.
{{Carus}} was drumming {{ hisd(Carus) }} nails on top of {{ hisd(Carus) }} desk by the time the Fox finished. "Let me see if I understand you correctly," {{ he(Carus) }} said. "You expect the troops of the Empire to get you out of trouble with this {{ wizard(Balamung) }}, into which you have gotten yourself. Now to justify this request for service, you may point to—what?"
"Among other things, that we border barons have kept the Trokmoi out of the Empire for two hundred years and more."
"A trivium." {{Carus}} waved {{ hisd(Carus) }} hand in a languid southern gesture which might have seemed courtly from Rihwin but was only grotesque in a {{ man(Carus) }} of the Marchwarden's years and girth. "If I had my way, we would merely send a few thousand tons of stone down behind the Great Gate. That would quite nicely seal off the barbarians for all time."
"Horseballs," {{Gerin}} muttered. {{Elise}} heard {{ him(Gerin) }} and grinned. {{Carus}} heard {{ him(Gerin) }} too. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} had not intended that.
"Horseballs?" {{Carus}}' mouth moved in what might have been a smile, but {{ hisd(Carus) }} eyes stayed cold. "Ah, the vivid turn of phrase of the frontier. But do let me return to what I was saying: indeed, I think the Empire would be as well off without you. What do we gain from you, after all? No metals, no grain—only trouble. Half the rebels of the past two hundred years have had northern ties. You corrupt the calm, orderly way of life we crave. No, my good {{ lord(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}, if the barbarians can eat you up, they are welcome to you."
The Fox had not really expected help from the Marchwarden, but {{ he(Gerin) }} had not expected outright hatred, either. {{ He(Gerin) }} drew in a long, angry breath. {{Elise}} pressed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hand in warning, but {{ he(Gerin) }} was too furious to pay heed. {{ He(Gerin) }} spoke in the same polished phrases {{Carus}} had used, and the same venom rode them: "You complain the Empire receives nothing from us? Up on the border, we wonder what we get from you. Where are the soldiers and chariots of the Empire, to help us drive away the northern raiders? Where are they when we fight among ourselves? Do you care? Not a bit, for if we are kept distracted, we cannot think of rebellion. You judge, and rightly, our flesh and blood a better shield than any you might make of stone or wood, and so we die, for nothing."
Bowing to {{Carus}}, {{Gerin}} stood to go. "And you, my fine Marchwarden, you have gained most of all from our thankless toil. While we sweat and bleed to keep the border safe, here you have stayed for the past twenty-five years, shuffling parchments from one pile to the next and sitting on your fat fornicating fundament!" The last was a roar of surprising volume.
{{Carus}} leaped to {{ hisd(Carus) }} feet, fumbling for {{ hisd(Carus) }} sword but finding only an empty scabbard. {{Gerin}} laughed mockingly. "Guards!" the Marchwarden bleated. When the soldiers appeared, {{ he(Carus) }} gabbled, "Clap this insolent lout in chains and cast {{ him(Gerin) }} in the dungeon until {{ he(Gerin) }} learns politeness." {{ Hisd(Carus) }} eyes lingered on {{Elise}}. {{ He(Carus) }} reached out a flabby hand to take {{ herd(Elise) }} arm. "I will undertake to instruct the {{ wench(Elise) }} personally."
The befuddlement on the guards' faces was ludicrous; they had not seen their {{ master(Carus) }} so active in years. {{Gerin}} made no move for {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own blade. {{ He(Gerin) }} said mildly, "Do you know what will happen if you seize us? As soon as the barons learn of it, they will come down in a body and leave your precious barracks so much kindling. Not long after that, the Trokmoi will be here to light it. I'm almost sorry you won't live to watch."
"What? What nonsense are you spewing now? I'll—gark!" {{Carus}}' voice abruptly disappeared. {{Elise}} was tickling the soft skin under {{ hisd(Carus) }} chin with the tip of {{ herd(Elise) }} dagger. {{ She(Elise) }} smiled sweetly at {{ him(Carus) }}. The blood drained from {{ hisd(Carus) }} face, leaving it the color of the parchment on {{ hisd(Carus) }} desk. Moving very carefully, {{ he(Carus) }} let go of {{ herd(Elise) }} arm. "Go," {{ he(Carus) }} said, in ragged parody of the tone {{ he(Carus) }} had used a moment before. "Get out. Guards, take them away."
"To the dungeons, {{ sirm(Carus) }}?" asked one, scorn in {{ hisd(Carus) }} voice.
"No, no, just go." {{Carus}} sank back into {{ hisd(Carus) }} chair, hands shaking and sweat gleaming on {{ hisd(Carus) }} bald head. With as much ceremony as if it were a daily occurrence, {{ hisd(Carus) }} soldiers conducted {{Gerin}} and {{Elise}} from the Marchwarden's presence.
The sun was still high in the southwest; the audience had made up in heat what it lacked in length. {{Gerin}} turned to {{Elise}} and said, "I knew having you along would be a nuisance. Once {{ he(Gerin) }} caught a glimpse of you, the old lecher couldn't find a way to get me out of there fast enough."
"Don't be ridiculous. I'm a mess." Of itself, {{ herd(Elise) }} hand moved to brush at {{ herd(Elise) }} hair.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} surveyed {{ her(Elise) }}. There was dust in {{ herd(Elise) }} hair and a smudge of grime on {{ herd(Elise) }} forehead, but {{ herd(Elise) }} green eyes sparkled, the mild doses of sun {{ she(Elise) }} allowed {{ herself(Elise) }} had brought out a spray of freckles on {{ herd(Elise) }} nose and cheeks, {{ herd(Elise) }} lips were soft and red, and even in tunic and trousers {{ she(Elise) }} was plainly no {{ boy-opp(Elise) }}. . . .
Easy there, {{Gerin}} told {{ himself(Gerin) }}: do you want to make {{Ricolf}} your irreconcilable enemy too, along with the Trokmoi and Wolfar? {{ He(Gerin) }} gave {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ beard2m(Gerin) }} a judicious tug. "You'll do," {{ he(Gerin) }} said. "You'll definitely do."
{{ She(Elise) }} snorted and poked {{ him(Gerin) }} in the ribs. {{ He(Gerin) }} yelped and mimed a grab at {{ her(Elise) }}; {{ she(Elise) }} made as if to stab {{ him(Gerin) }}. They were still smiling half an hour later, when Van pulled up in the wagon. {{ He(Van) }} smelled of horses and beer, and had two new beasts in the traces. A grin split {{ hisd(Van) }} face when {{ he(Van) }} saw how happy {{Gerin}} looked. "{{ Himself(Carus) }} gave you the troops, did {{ he(Carus) }}?"
"What? Oh. No, I'm afraid not." The Fox explained the fiasco; Van laughed loud and long. {{Gerin}} went on, "I expected nothing much, and got just that. You seem to have been busy, though—what sort of horse do you have there, anyway?" {{ He(Gerin) }} jerked a thumb at one of Van's newly acquired animals.
Unlike its companion, a handsome gray gelding, this rough-coated little beast was even less sightly than the shaggy woods-ponies of the Trokmoi. But Van looked scandalized. {{ He(Van) }} leaped down and rubbed the horse's muzzle.
A quick snap made {{ him(Van) }} jerk {{ hisd(Van) }} hand away. Even so, {{ he(Van) }} said, "Captain, don't tell me you don't know a Shanda horse when you see one? The fool trader who had him didn't. {{ He(merchant) }} thought {{ he(merchant) }} was putting one over on me. Well, let {{ him(merchant) }} laugh. A Shanda horse will go all day and all night; you can't wear one down if you try. I like the bargain, and you will too."
"All right, show me." {{Gerin}} helped {{Elise}} up, then climbed on {{ himself(Gerin) }}. Van followed. The wagon clattered out of Cassat toward the Great Gate, the sole remaining link the Empire allowed itself with its northern provinces.
It was a long pull through the Gate. Toward the end, the gray horse was lathered and blowing, but the pony from the plains showed no more sign of strain than if it had spent the day grazing. {{Gerin}} was impressed.
Though Elabon had not blocked this last way through the Kirs, its marshals had done their best to make sure no enemy could use it. Fortresses of brick and stone flanked the roadway. Watchmen tramped smartly along their battlements, alert against any mischance. The towers' bronze-sheathed wooden gates were closed now, but could open to vomit forth chariots and footsoldiers against any invader.
{{ Wizard(Balamung) }}s, too, aided in defending the Empire. They had their own dwellings, twin needle-like spires of what seemed to be multicolored glass, off which the late afternoon sun shimmered and sparkled. Should the fortresses' armed might fail to blunt an attack, the warlocks would set in motion the thousands of boulders heaped on either side of the pass, and thus block it forever.
The arrangement left {{Gerin}} uneasy: what wizardry had made, it could unmake. {{ He(Gerin) }} cheered slightly when {{ he(Gerin) }} discovered the warriors in the fastnesses could also start the avalanche by purely natural means: paths led up to the tops of the piles of scree, and triggering rocks there had levers under them. The Fox did not envy those who would work those levers.
The succession of powerful strongholds awed even Van. "Folk who huddle behind forts are dead inside," {{ he(Van) }} said, "but with forts like these it will be a while yet before anyone notices the reek of the corpse."
A brown and buff lizard chased a grasshopper into the road. It danced madly under hooves and wagon wheels, then vanished into a crevice in the rocks on the far side. {{Gerin}} never knew whether it had caught its bug.
Traffic through the Great Gates was heavy. Traders headed north. Their donkeys brayed loud disgust at the weight of the packs they bore. Traders came south. Their donkeys brayed loud disgust over nothing at all. Mercenaries, wandering wise {{ men(wizard2) }}, {{ wizard(wizard2) }}s, and a good many travelers who fell into no neat scheme—all used the imperial highway.
Nearly two hours went by before the wagon reached the end of the pass. Golden under the light of the setting sun, the southern land spread out ahead like a picture from a landscape master's brush. Field and forest, town and orchard, all were plain to see, with brooks and rivers like lines of molten copper.
"It's a rare pretty country," Van said. "What are the people like?"
"People," {{Gerin}} shrugged.
"I'd best keep an eye on my wallet, then."
"Go howl! You'd bite a coin free-given."
"Likely I would, if I planned to spend it."
"Scoffer!"
Just then a warm, dry breeze wafted up from the south. It was sweet and spicy, with the faintest tang of salt from the distant Inner Sea, and carried scents the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had forgotten.
Like a swift stream breaching the dam that restrained it, long-buried memories flooded up in {{Gerin}}. {{ He(Gerin) }} thought of the two years free from care {{ he(Gerin) }} had spent in the capital, then of the sterile, worry-filled time since—and was appalled.
"Why did I ever leave you?" {{ he(Gerin) }} cried to the waiting land ahead. "{{Father(Dyaus) }} {{Dyaus}}, you know I would sooner have been a starving schoolmaster in the capital than {{ king(Gerin) }} of all the northlands!"
"If that's how you feel, why not stay in the south?" {{Elise}} asked. {{ Herd(Elise) }} voice was gentle, for the fair land ahead had enchanted {{ her(Elise) }} as much as the Fox.
"Why not indeed?" {{Gerin}} said surprised. {{ He(Gerin) }} realized the notion had never crossed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind, and wondered why. At last {{ he(Gerin) }} sighed and shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. "Were the danger behind me less great, I'd leap at the chance like a starving longtooth. But for better or worse, my life is on the cooler side of the mountains. Much depends on me there. If I stay, I betray more than my own people, I think. The land will fall to {{Balamung}}, and I doubt it will slake {{ hisd(Balamung) }} evil thirst. That may happen yet; the gods have given the northland little enough hope. It's partly my fault {{Balamung}} is what {{ he(Balamung) }} is; if I can make amends, I will."
"I think you will do well," {{Elise}} said slowly. "Often, it seems, the most glory is won by those who seek it least."
"Glory? If I can stay alive and free without it, I don't give a moldy loaf of journeybread for glory. I leave all that to Van."
"Ha!" Van said. "Do you want to know the real reason {{ he(Gerin) }}'s bound to go back, my {{ lady(Elise) }}?"
"Tell me," {{Gerin}} said, curious to see what slander {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend would come up with.
"Captain, you'd need more than a {{ wizard(Balamung) }} to drive you away from your books, and you know it as well as I do." There was enough truth in that to make {{Gerin}} throw a lazy punch at Van, who ducked. A good part of the barony's silver flowed south to the copyists and bookdealers in Elabon's capital.
They wound their way down from the pass, hoping to reach a town before the sun disappeared. {{Gerin}} was less worried about the ghosts than {{ he(Gerin) }} would have been on the other side of the mountains; peace had reigned here for many years, and the spirits were relatively mild. For {{ hisd(Van) }} part, Van grew eloquent about the advantages of fresh food, a mug of ale (or even wine!), a comfortable bed, and perhaps (though {{ he(Van) }} did not say so) a {{ wench(lover2) }} to warm it.
The road was flanked by a grove of fruit trees of a kind unknown north of the Kirs. Not very tall, they had gray-brown bark, shiny light-green leaves, and egg-shaped yellow fruit. Both leaves and fruit were fragrant, but {{Gerin}} remembered how astonishingly sour the fruit was to the tongue. It was called . . . {{ he(Gerin) }} snapped {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fingers in annoyance. {{ He(Gerin) }} had forgotten the very name.
As the trees began to thin, another smell made its presence known through their perfume: a faint carrion reek. The {{ baron(Gerin) }}'s lips drew back in a mirthless grimace. "I think we've found our town," {{ he(Gerin) }} said.
The road turned, the screen of trees disappeared, and sure enough the town was there. It was not big enough to have a wall. The Fox was sure folk living ten miles from it had never heard its name. Nonetheless, it aspired to cityhood in a way open to the meanest of hamlets: by the road stood a row of crucifixes, each with its slow-rotting burden. Under them children played, now and then shying a stone upward. Dogs slunk there too, dogs with poor masters or none, waiting for easy meals.
Some of the spiked and roped criminals were not yet dead. Through sun-baked and blistered lips they begged for water or death, each according to the strength left in them. One, newly elevated or unnaturally strong, still howled defiance at gods and men.
The criminal’s roars annoyed the carrion birds nearby. Strong black bills filled with noisome food, they flapped lazily into the sky, staring down with fine impartiality on town, travelers, and field. They knew all would come to them in good time.
Van's face might have been carved from stone as {{ he(Van) }} surveyed the wretches. {{Elise}} was pale. {{ Herd(Elise) }} eyes went wide with horror. {{ Herd(Elise) }} lips shaped the word "Why?" but no sound emerged. {{Gerin}} tried not to remember {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own thoughts when {{ he(Gerin) }}'d first encountered the malignant notions of justice the southerners had borrowed from Sithonia.
"Maybe," {{ he(Gerin) }} said grimly, "I had my reasons for going home, after all."
<h2>VI</h2>
The town ({{Gerin}} learned its name was Fibis) did little to restore the luster of the southlands in the {{ baron(Gerin) }}'s eyes. The houses lining the north-south road were little finer than the huts of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} peasants. Only muddy alleys ankle-deep in slops led away from that road.
The sole hostel Fibis boasted was of a piece with the rest. It was low-roofed, dingy, and small. The sign outside had faded past legibility. Within, the smell of old grease fought with but could not overcome the odor of stale urine from the dyeworks next door and the never-absent stench of the crosses.
And the townsfolk! City ways that had been sophisticated to the {{ youth(Gerin) }} who traveled this road ten years before now seemed either foppish or surly. {{Gerin}} tried to strike up a conversation with the innkeeper, a dour, weathered old {{ codger(Grizzard) }} named {{Grizzard}}, but got only grunts in return. {{ He(Gerin) }} gave up and went back to the rickety table where {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friends awaited supper. "If I didn't know better," {{ he(Gerin) }} said, "I'd take oath the {{ fellow(Grizzard) }} was afraid of me."
"Then {{ he(Grizzard) }} thinks you've already tasted {{ hisd(Grizzard) }} wine," said Van, who was on {{ hisd(Van) }} third mug. "What swill!" {{ He(Van) }} swigged, pursed {{ hisd(Van) }} lips to spit, but swallowed instead.
The rest of the meal was not much better than the wine. Plainly, lack of competition was all that kept {{Grizzard}} in business. Disgusted with the long, fruitless day {{ he(Gerin) }} had put in, {{Gerin}} was about to head for bed when a cheery voice said, "Hello, you're new here! What's old {{Grizzard}} given you to drink?"
Without so much as a by-your-leave, the {{ fellow(Tevis) }} pulled up a chair and joined them. {{ He(Tevis) }} sniffed the wine, grimaced, and flipped a spinning silver disk to the innkeeper, who made it disappear. "You can do better than this, you thief," {{ he(Tevis) }} said. To the Fox's surprise, {{Grizzard}} could.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} studied {{ hisd(Gerin) }} new acquaintance curiously, for the {{ man(Tevis) }} seemed made of pieces which did not belong together. Despite {{ hisd(Tevis) }} heartiness, {{ hisd(Tevis) }} voice soon dropped so low {{Grizzard}} could not hear what {{ he(Tevis) }} said. While {{ hisd(Tevis) }} mouth was full of slang from the capital, {{ hisd(Tevis) }} homespun tunic and {{ trousers(Tevis) }} were both rustic. Yet {{ hisd(Tevis) }} chin sported a gray imperial and {{ hisd(Tevis) }} shoes turned up at the toes: both Sithonian styles. The name {{ he(Tevis) }} gave—just {{Tevis}}, without patronymic or sobriquet—was one of the three or four commonest south of the mountains.
Whoever {{ he(Tevis) }} was, {{ he(Tevis) }} had a rare skill with words. Softly, easily, {{ he(Tevis) }} enticed from {{Gerin}} (usually as close-mouthed as any {{ man(Gerin) }} alive) the story of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} travels, and all without revealing a bit of {{ hisd(Tevis) }} own purpose. It was almost as if {{ he(Tevis) }} cast a spell. {{ He(Tevis) }} paused a while in silent consideration, {{ hisd(Tevis) }} clear dark eyes studying the Fox. "You have not been well-used by the Empire," {{ he(Tevis) }} said at last.
{{Gerin}} only shrugged. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} caution had returned. {{ He(Gerin) }} was wary of this smooth-talking {{ man(Tevis) }} of mystery. {{Tevis}} nodded, as if {{ he(Tevis) }} had expected nothing more. "Tell me," {{ he(Tevis) }} said, "do you know of {{Moribar}} the Magnificent, {{ hisd(Emperor) }} imperial majesty's governor at Kortys?"
Van, who had drunk deep, stared at {{Tevis}} in owlish incomprehension. {{Elise}} was nearly asleep, {{ herd(Elise) }} head warm on {{Gerin}}'s shoulder. {{ Herd(Elise) }} hair tickled {{ hisd(Gerin) }} cheek. The scent of it filled {{ hisd(Gerin) }} nose. But in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind the stench of the rood was stronger still. Here was the very thing {{Carus}} Beo's {{ son(Carus) }} had feared most: a potential rebel in the capital of Sithonia, seeking northern help.
At any other time, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} would have shed no tears to see the Empire go up in civil war, but now {{ he(Gerin) }} needed whatever strength {{ he(Gerin) }} could find at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} back. {{ He(Gerin) }} chose {{ hisd(Gerin) }} words with care: "Tevis, I don't know you and I didn't ask to know you. If you say one word more to me, you will have spoken treason, and I will not hear it. True, I've had my quarrels with some of {{ hisd(Emperor) }} majesty's servants, but if {{ he(Emperor) }} does not plot against me in my land, I have no right to plot against {{ him(Emperor) }} in {{ his(Emperor) }}. I would not have drunk with you had I known what was in your mind. Here, take this and go." {{ He(Gerin) }} set a coin on the table to pay for the jug of wine.
Tevis smiled faintly. "Keep it," {{ he(Tevis) }} said, "and this as well." {{ He(Tevis) }} took something from the pouch on {{ hisd(Tevis) }} belt, tossed it next to the coin, and was gone into the night while {{Gerin}} still gaped at what {{ he(Tevis) }} had thrown: a tiny bronze hand, fingers beginning to curl into a fist.
"Oh, great {{Dyaus}} above!" {{ he(Gerin) }} said. "An Imperial Hand!" {{ He(Gerin) }} propped {{ hisd(Gerin) }} chin on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} palm and stared at the little token before {{ him(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} could have been no more startled had it sprung up and slapped {{ him(Gerin) }} in the face.
Bristles rasped under Van's fingers as {{ he(Van) }} scratched {{ hisd(Van) }} jaw. "And what in the five hells is that?" {{ he(Van) }} asked with ponderous patience.
"A secret agent, spy, informer . . . call {{ him(Tevis) }} what you will. That doesn't matter. But if I'd shown any interest in setting {{Moribar}} on the throne, by this time tomorrow we'd be on crosses side by side, waiting for the vultures to pick out our eyes."
"Ha! I'd bite off their heads!" Van seemed more concerned with the vultures than the crucifixion that would invite them.
"That's one way of dealing with them, I suppose," {{Gerin}} agreed mildly. {{ He(Gerin) }} woke {{Elise}}. {{ She(Elise) }} yawned and walked sleepily to the one room {{Grizzard}} grudged {{ ladyt(Elise) }} travelers. Van and {{Gerin}} headed for their own pallets, hoping they would not be bug-ridden. Almost as an afterthought, the Fox scooped up the diminutive but deadly emblem Tevis had left behind.
Though weary, {{ he(Gerin) }} slept poorly. The quarrel with {{Carus}}, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} jarring reintroduction to the dark side of the southlands, and above all the brush with doom in the form of Tevis kept {{ him(Gerin) }} tossing all night. The bed was hard and lumpy, too. When {{ he(Gerin) }} awoke, half a dozen red, itchy spots on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} arms and chest proved {{ he(Gerin) }} had not slept alone.
Van was unusually quiet at breakfast. "Head hurt?" {{Gerin}} asked as they walked to the stables.
"What. Oh. No, it's not that, captain." Van hesitated. Finally {{ he(Van) }} said, "I'll tell you right out, {{Gerin}}, last night I almost decided to buy myself a gig and get the blazes out of this crazy country."
{{Gerin}} had imagined disaster piled on disaster, but never in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} worst nightmares had {{ he(Gerin) }} imagined {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend leaving. Ever since Van came to Fox Keep the two of them had been inseparable, fighting back to back and then carousing and yarning far into the night. Each owed the other their life several times. With a shock, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} realized Van was a larger, gustier version of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} dead {{ brother(Dagref) }} {{Dagref}}. Losing {{ him(Van) }} would be more than parting with a comrade; part of the {{ baron(Gerin) }}'s soul would go with {{ him(Van) }}.
Before {{ he(Gerin) }} could put what {{ he(Gerin) }} felt into words, {{Elise}} spoke first: "Why would you want to leave now? Are you afraid? The danger is in the north, not here." {{ She(Elise) }} seemed unwilling to believe {{ herd(Elise) }} ears.
At any other time, the outlander's wrath would have kindled if {{ hisd(Van) }} courage was questioned. Now {{ he(Van) }} only sighed and kicked at a pebble. Genuine distress was in {{ hisd(Van) }} voice as {{ he(Van) }} answered, "My {{ lady(Elise) }}, look about you." {{ Hisd(Van) }} wave encompassed not just the grubby little hamlet of Fibis and the crosses outside it, but all the land where the writ of the Empire was law. "You've seen enough of me to know what I am and what my pleasures are: fighting, talking, drinking, aye, and wenching too, I'll not deny. But here, what good am I? If I break wind in the backhouse, I have to look over my shoulder lest some listening spy call it treason. It's not the kind of life I care to lead: worrying before I move, not daring even to think."
{{Gerin}} understood that well enough, for much the same sense of oppression weighed on {{ him(Gerin) }}. But Van was still talking: "I was all set to take my leave of you this morning—head north again, I suppose. But then I got to thinking"—{{ he(Van) }} suddenly grinned—"and I decided that if any goat-loving Imperial Hand doesn't like the way I speak, why, I'll carve the {{ son(Tevis) }} of a pimp into steaks and leave {{ him(Tevis) }} by the side of the road to warn {{ hisd(Tevis) }} scurvy cousins!"
{{Elise}} laughed in delight and kissed {{ him(Van) }} on the cheek.
"I think you planned this whole thing just to get that kiss," {{Gerin}} said. "Come on, you hulk, quit holding up the works."
"{{ Bastard(Gerin) }}." Still grinning, Van pitched {{ hisd(Van) }} gear into the wagon.
* * *
The morning was still young when they splashed through the chilly Langros river. Though not as great as the Niffet or the mighty Carastos which watered much of the plain of Elabon, its cold current ran swift as it leaped down from the Kirs toward the Greater Inner Sea.
The water at the ford swirled icily around {{Gerin}}'s toes and welled up between the wagon's floorboards. Most of the travelers' belongings were safe in oiled leather sacks, but half the journeybread turned to slimy brown paste. {{Gerin}} swore in disgust. Van said, "Cheer up, captain, the stuff wasn't worth eating anyhow."
When they stopped to rest and eat, Van turned to {{Gerin}} and said quietly, "Thanks for not pushing me this morning. You might have made it hard for me to stay."
"I know," {{Gerin}} said. Neither of them mentioned the matter again.
They made good progress that day, passing small farms in the foothills and then, as the land began to level out, going by great estates with splendid manor-houses set well back from the road. When shadows lengthened and cool evening breezes began to blow, they camped by the roadside instead of seeking an inn. {{Gerin}} fed and watered the horses as the sun set. In the growing darkness the ghosts appeared, but their wails were somehow muted, their cries almost croons.
Elleb's thin crescent soon followed the sun, like a small child staying close to a parent. That left the sky to the stars and Math, whose gibbous disk bathed the land beyond reach of the campfire in pale golden light. As the night went on, {{ she(Math) }} was joined by {{Tiwaz}}, whose speedy flight through the heavens had taken {{ him(Tiwaz) }} well past full. And, when {{Gerin}}'s watch was nearly done, Nothos poked a slow-moving head over the horizon. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} watched the moon climb for most of an hour, then gave the night to Van.
The next day gave every promise of rolling along as smoothly as had its predecessor. The promise was abruptly broken a bit before noon. A manor-holder had decided to send geese to market. The road was jammed by an endless array of tall white birds herded along by a dozen or so servants with sticks. The geese honked, cackled, squabbled, and tried to sneak off the road for a mouthful of grain. They did everything, in fact, but hurry. When {{Gerin}} asked their warders to clear a way so {{ he(Gerin) }} could pass, they refused. "If these blame birds get into the fields," one said, "we'll be three days getting them all out again, and our {{ lord(Gerin) }}'ll have our heads."
"Let's charge right through," Van suggested. "Can't you see the feathers fly?"
The thought of a goose stampede brought a smile to {{Gerin}}'s lips, but {{ he(Gerin) }} said, "No, these poor folks have their job to do too, I suppose." And so they fretted and fumed while the birds dawdled along in front of them. More traffic piled up behind.
As time dragged on, Van's direct approach looked better and better. The whip twitched in {{Gerin}}'s hand. But before {{ he(Gerin) }} used it, {{ he(Gerin) }} noticed the road was coming to a fork. The geese streamed down the eastern path. "Can we use the western branch to get to the capital?" {{ he(Gerin) }} called.
"You can that," one of the flock-tenders answered, so the Fox swung the wagon down the new way.
New? Hardly. {{Gerin}} noticed that none of the others stalled behind the geese used the clear road. Soon enough, {{ he(Gerin) }} found out why. The eastern branch of the highway was far newer. After it was complete, evidently nobody had bothered with the other one again. The wagon jounced and rattled as it banged over gaping holes in the roadbed. On one stretch, the paved surface vanished altogether. There the blocks had been set, not in concrete, but in molten lead. Locals had carried away blocks and valuable mortar alike as soon as imperial inspectors no longer bothered to protect them. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} cursed the lout who had sent {{ him(Gerin) }} down this road. {{ He(Gerin) }} hoped {{ he(Gerin) }} could make it without breaking a wheel.
The district had perhaps once been prosperous, but had decayed when its road was superseded. The farther they went, the thicker the forest grew, until at last its arms clasped above the roadway and squirrels flirted their bushy gray tails directly overhead.
Soon the very memory of the road would be gone.
Finding a village in the midst of such decline seemed divine intervention. The villagers fell on {{Gerin}} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friends like long-lost relatives, plying them with food and a rough, heady country wine and listening eagerly to every word they brought of the world outside. Not a copper would they take in payment. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} blessed such kindly folk, and blessed them doubly when they confirmed that the road did in fact eventually lead to the capital instead of sinking into a bog.
"You see, captain? You worry too much," Van said. "Everything will work out all right."
{{Gerin}} did not answer. {{ He(Gerin) }} could not let things work out all right; {{ he(Gerin) }} had to make them do so. Backtracking would have cost {{ him(Gerin) }} a day {{ he(Gerin) }} could not afford to spend.
The villagers insisted on putting up their guests for the night. {{Gerin}}'s host was a lean farmer named {{Badoc}} {{ son(Badoc) }} of Tevis (the {{ baron(Gerin) }} hid a shiver). Other villagers, just as anxious for news, claimed {{Elise}} and Van.
The benches round {{Badoc}}'s table were filled to overflowing by the farmer, {{ hisd(Badoc) }} plump, friendly {{ wife-opp(Badoc) }} Leunadar, the Fox, and a swarm of children. These ranged in age from a boy barely able to toddle to {{Badoc}}'s twin {{ daughters(Elise) }} Callis and Elmindar, who were about seventeen. {{Gerin}} eyed the striking {{ girls(Elise) }} appreciatively. They had curly hair, sparkling brown eyes, and cheeks rosy under sun-bestowed bronze; their thin linen tunics clung to firm {{ breasts(Elise) }}. As subtly as {{ he(Gerin) }} could, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} turned the conversation in their direction. They hung on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} every word . . . so long as {{ he(Gerin) }} was talking about Van. To {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own charms they remained sublimely indifferent.
"I wish your friend could stay here," one of the twins mourned; {{Gerin}} had forgotten which was which. They both babbled on about Van's thews, {{ hisd(Van) }} armor, {{ hisd(Van) }} rugged features, {{ hisd(Van) }} smile . . . and on and on, until {{Gerin}} began to hate the sound of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} comrade's name. {{Badoc}}'s craggy face almost smiled as {{ he(Badoc) }} watched {{ hisd(Badoc) }} guest's discomfiture.
At last the ordeal was over. The {{ baron(Gerin) }}, quite alone and by then glad of it, went to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bed. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} feet hung over the end, for {{Badoc}} had ousted one of {{ hisd(Badoc) }} younger {{ sons(Gerin) }} to accommodate the Fox. {{Gerin}} was tired enough that it fazed {{ him(Gerin) }} not a bit.
A {{ woman(Mavrix) }}'s cry woke {{ him(Gerin) }} around midnight. Another followed, then another, long and drawn out: "Evoi! Evoiii!" The {{ baron(Gerin) }} relaxed; it was only the followers of Mavrix, the Sithonian {{ god(Mavrix) }} of wine, out on one of their moonlight revels. {{Gerin}} was a bit surprised Mavrix's cult had spread to this out-of-the-way place, but what of it? {{ He(Gerin) }} went back to sleep.
The next morning {{ he(Gerin) }} discovered the considerate villagers had not only curried {{ hisd(Gerin) }} horses till their coats gleamed, but also left gifts of fresh bread, wine, cheese, onions, and bars of dried fruit and meat in the back of the wagon. A troop of small {{ boys(Gerin) }} followed {{ him(Gerin) }} south until their parents finally called them home.
"I almost hate to leave," Van said. {{Gerin}} studied {{ him(Van) }}: was {{ he(Van) }} still wearing the traces of a satisfied grin? What if {{ he(Van) }} is, witling? the {{ baron(Gerin) }} asked {{ himself(Gerin) }}. Do you begrudge {{ him(Van) }} {{ hisd(Van) }} good fortune? Well, yes, a little, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} inner voice answered.
The road was a bit better south of the village; at least it never disappeared. Under the trees the air was cool and moist, the sunlight subdued. {{Gerin}} felt more at home than {{ he(Gerin) }} had since leaving {{Ricolf}}'s keep. {{ He(Gerin) }} was not alone. {{ He(Gerin) }} heard {{Elise}} softly humming a song of the north country. {{ She(Elise) }} smiled when {{ she(Elise) }} saw {{ him(Gerin) }} watching {{ her(Elise) }}.
They came to a clearing almost wide enough to be called a meadow, hidden away deep in the forest. The Fox squinted at the sudden brightness. A doe which had been nibbling at the soft grass by the forest's edge lifted its head at the wagon's noisy arrival and sprang into the woods.
"Pull over, will you?" Van said. The outlander reached for {{Gerin}}'s bow and quiver. Though {{ he(Van) }} disdained archery in battle, {{ he(Van) }} loved to hunt and was a fine shot. {{ He(Van) }} trotted across the clearing and vanished among the trees with grace and silence a hunting cat might have envied.
Sighing, {{Gerin}} threw down the reins and stretched out full-length on the sweet-smelling grass. Sore muscles began to unkink. {{Elise}} stepped down and joined {{ him(Gerin) }}. The horses were as glad at the break as the people; they cropped the grass with as much alacrity as the deer had shown.
Minute followed minute, but Van gave no sign of returning. "{{ He(Van) }}'s probably forgotten which end of the arrow goes first," {{Gerin}} said. {{ He(Gerin) }} rose, went to the wagon, and emerged with Van's spear. "Carrying this, I shouldn't wonder." Every time {{ he(Gerin) }} touched it, {{ he(Gerin) }} marveled at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend's skill with such a heavy weapon.
{{ He(Gerin) }} practiced slow thrusts and parries to while away the time, more than a little conscious of {{Elise}}'s eyes on {{ him(Gerin) }}. Showing off in front of a pretty {{ girl(Elise) }} was a pleasure {{ he(Gerin) }} did not get often enough. More and more {{ he(Gerin) }} resented the wound that had kept {{ him(Gerin) }} from courting this particular pretty {{ girl(Elise) }}.
It was not that {{ he(Gerin) }} lacked for {{ women(Elise) }} in his bed. If nothing else, a {{ baron(Gerin) }}'s prerogatives were enough to prevent that, though {{ he(Gerin) }} was moderate in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} enjoyment of them and never bedded a {{ wench(Elise) }} unwilling. But none of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} partners had roused more than {{ hisd(Gerin) }} lusts, and {{ he(Gerin) }} quickly tired of each new liaison. In {{Elise}} {{ he(Gerin) }} was beginning to suspect something {{ he(Gerin) }} had thought rare to the point of nonexistence: a kindred soul.
{{ He(Gerin) }} had just dispatched another imaginary foe when a crackle in the bushes on the far side of the clearing made {{ him(Gerin) }} raise {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. Van back at last, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought; {{ he(Gerin) }} filled {{ hisd(Gerin) }} lungs to shout a greeting. It died unuttered. Only a thin whisper emerged, and that directed at {{Elise}}: "Do just what I tell you. Walk very slowly to the far side of the wagon, then run for the woods. Move!" {{ he(Gerin) }} snapped when {{ she(Elise) }} hesitated. {{ He(Gerin) }} made sure {{ she(Elise) }} was on {{ herd(Elise) }} way before loping into the middle of the clearing to confront the aurochs.
It was a bull, a great roan, shaggy shoulders higher than a tall man's head. Scars old and new crisscrossed its hide. Its right horn was a shattered ruin, broken in some combat or accident long ago. The other curved out and forward, a glittering spear of death.
The aurochs' ears twitched as it stared at the puny {{ man(Gerin) }} who dared challenge it. The certainty of a charge lay like a lump of ice in {{Gerin}}'s belly: any aurochs would attack man or beast, but a lone bull was doubly terrible. {{Drago}}'s {{ grandfather(Gerin) }} had died under the horns and stamping hooves of just such a foe.
Quicker even than the Fox expected, the charge came. The beast's hooves sent chunks of sod flying skyward. There was no time to throw Van's spear. {{Gerin}} could only hurl {{ himself(Gerin) }} to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} left, diving to the turf. {{ He(Gerin) }} had a glimpse of a green eye filled with insane hatred. Then the aurochs was past, the jagged stump of its horn passing just over {{ him(Gerin) }}. The rank smell of its skin fought the clean odors of grass and dirt.
{{Gerin}} was on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} feet in an instant. But the aurochs was already wheeling for another charge, faster than any four-footed beast had any right to be. The Fox hurled {{ hisd(Gerin) }} spear, but the cast was hurried and high. It flew over the aurochs' shoulder. Only a desperate leap saved {{Gerin}}. Had the bull had two horns, {{ he(Gerin) }} would surely have been spitted. As it was, {{ he(Gerin) }} knew {{ he(Gerin) }} could not elude it much longer in the open.
{{ He(Gerin) }} sprang up and sprinted for the forest, snatching the spear as {{ he(Gerin) }} ran. Behind {{ him(Gerin) }} came the drumroll of the aurochs' hooves. The small of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} back tingled, anticipating the horn. Then, breath sobbing in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} throat, {{ he(Gerin) }} was among the trees. Timber cracked as the aurochs smashed through brush and saplings. Still, it had to slow as it followed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} dodges from tree to tree.
{{ He(Gerin) }} hoped to lose it in the wood, but it pursued {{ him(Gerin) }} with a deadly patience {{ he(Gerin) }} had never known an aurochs to show. Its bellows and snorts of rage rang loud in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ears. Deeper and deeper into the forest {{ he(Gerin) }} ran, following a vague game trail.
That came to an abrupt end: some time not long before, a forest giant had toppled, falling directly across the path. Its collapse brought down other trees and walled off the trail as thoroughly as any work of man's might have done. {{Gerin}} clambered over the dead timer. The aurochs was not far behind.
The Fox's wits had been frozen in dismay from the moment the aurochs appeared in the clearing. They began to work again as {{ he(Gerin) }} leaped down from the deadfall. Panting, "I can't run any farther anyway," {{ he(Gerin) }} jabbed the bronze-clad butt of Van's spear deep into the soft earth, then blundered away into the forest, having thrown {{ hisd(Gerin) }} dice for the last time.
Ever louder came the thunder of the aurochs' hooves, till the Fox could feel the ground shake. For a terrible moment, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought it would try to batter through the dead trees, but it must have known that was beyond its power. It hurled its bulk into the air, easily clearing the man-high barrier—and spitted itself on the upthrust spear.
The tough wood of the spearshaft shivered into a thousand splinters, but the leaf-shaped bronze point was driven deep into the aurochs' vitals. It staggered a couple of steps on wobbling legs, blood spurting from its belly. Then a great gout poured from its mouth and nose. It shuddered and fell. Its sides heaved a last time, then were still. It gave the Fox a reproachful brown bovine stare and died.
{{Gerin}} rubbed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eyes. In {{ hisd(Gerin) }} dance with death out on the meadow, {{ he(Gerin) }} had been sure the beast's eyes were green. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} own hand came away bloody. {{ He(Gerin) }} must have been swiped by a branch while dashing through the forest, but {{ he(Gerin) }} had no memory of it. Shows how much I know, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought. {{ He(Gerin) }} wearily climbed back over the deadfall.
{{ He(Gerin) }} had not gone far when Van came crashing down the game trail, drawn bow in {{ hisd(Van) }} hands. {{Elise}} was right behind {{ him(Van) }}. The outlander skidded to a stop, {{ hisd(Van) }} jaw dropping. "How are you, captain?" {{ he(Van) }} asked foolishly.
"Alive, much to my surprise."
"But—the aurochs . . . {{Elise}} said . . ." Van stopped, the picture of confusion.
{{Gerin}} was just glad {{Elise}} had had the sense to go after {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend instead of showing {{ herself(Elise) }} to the aurochs and probably getting {{ herself(Elise) }} killed. "I'm afraid I'll have to buy you a new spear when we get to the capital," {{ he(Gerin) }} said.
Van hauled {{ himself(Van) }} over the barrier. {{ He(Van) }} came back carrying the spearpoint; bronze was too valuable to leave. "What in the name of the trident of Shamadraka did you do?" {{ he(Van) }} asked.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} wondered where Shamadraka's worshipers lived; {{ he(Gerin) }} had never heard of the {{ god(Van) }}. "Climbing those trunks took everything I had left," {{ he(Gerin) }} said. "The beast was hunting me like a hound—I've never known anything like it. It would have had me in a few minutes. But by some miracle I remembered a fable I read a long time ago, about a slave who was too lazy to hunt. {{ He(Gerin) }}'d block a trail, set a javelin behind {{ hisd(Gerin) }} barrier, and wait for the deer to skewer themselves for {{ him(Gerin) }}."
{{Elise}} said, "I know the fable you mean: the tale of the Deer and Mahee. In the end {{ he(Gerin) }}'s killed by {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own spear, and a good thing, too. {{ He(Gerin) }} was a cruel, wicked {{ man(Gerin) }}."
"You got the idea for killing the brute out of a book?" Van shook {{ hisd(Van) }} head. "Out of a book? Captain, I swear I'll never sneer at reading again, if it can show you something that'll save your neck. The real pity of it is, you'll never have a chance to brag about this."
"And why not?" {{Gerin}} had been looking forward to doing just that.
"Slaying a bull aurochs singlehanded with a spear? Don't be a fool, Gerin: who would believe you?"
Van had killed {{ hisd(Van) }} doe while the {{ baron(Gerin) }} battled the aurochs. {{ He(Van) }} dumped the bled and gutted carcass into the wagon and urged the horses southward. None of the travelers wanted to spend the night near the body of the slain aurochs. Not only would it draw unwelcome scavengers, but the spilled blood was sure to lure hungry, lonely ghosts from far and wide, all eager to share the unexpected bounty of the kill.
When the failing light told them it was time to camp, the deer proved toothsome indeed. Van carved steaks from its flanks. They roasted the meat over a fire. But despite a full belly, the outlander was unhappy. {{ He(Van) }} grumbled, "I feel naked without my spear. What will I do without it in a fight?"
{{Gerin}} was less than sympathetic. "Seeing that you've brought a mace, an axe, three knives—"
"Only two. The third is just for eating."
"My apologies. Two knives, then, and a sword so heavy I can hardly lift it, let alone swing it. So I think you'll find some way to make a nuisance of yourself."
A nuisance Van was; {{ he(Van) }} plucked a long straw from {{Elise}}'s hand, leaving the short one—and the first watch—for {{Gerin}}. The Fox tried not to hear {{ hisd(Van) }} friend's comfort-filled snores. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} sense of the basic injustice of the universe was only slightly salved when {{Elise}} decided not to fall asleep at once.
{{Gerin}} was glad of {{ herd(Elise) }} company. Without it, {{ he(Gerin) }} probably would have dozed, for the night was almost silent. The sad murmurs of the ghosts, heard with the mind's ear rather than the body's, were also faint: the lure of the dead aurochs reached for miles, leaving the surrounding countryside all but bare of spirits.
For some reason the Fox could not fathom, {{Elise}} thought {{ he(Gerin) }} was a {{ hero(Gerin) }} for slaying the aurochs. {{ He(Gerin) }} felt more lucky than heroic. There was precious little glory involved in running like a rabbit, which was most of what {{ he(Gerin) }}'d done. Had {{ he(Gerin) }} not plucked what {{ he(Gerin) }} needed from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} rubbish-heap of a memory, the beast would have killed {{ him(Gerin) }}. "Fool luck," {{ he(Gerin) }} concluded.
"Nonsense," {{Elise}} said. "Don't make yourself less than you are. In the heat of the fight you were able to remember what you had to know and, more, to do something with it. You need more than muscle to make a {{ hero(Gerin) }}."
Not convinced, {{Gerin}} shrugged and changed the subject, asking {{Elise}} what {{ she(Elise) }} knew of {{ herd(Elise) }} kin in the capital. {{ Herd(Elise) }} closest relative there, it transpired, was {{ herd(Elise) }} {{ mother-opp(Ricolf) }}'s {{ brother(Valdabrun) }} {{Valdabrun}} the Stout, who held some position or other at the {{Emperor}}'s court. Though {{ he(Gerin) }} did not say, {{Gerin}} found that a dubious recommendation. {{ Hisd(Emperor) }} imperial majesty Hildor III was an indolent {{ dandy(Emperor) }}, and the {{ baron(Gerin) }} saw little reason to expect {{ hisd(Emperor) }} courtiers to be different.
To hide {{ hisd(Gerin) }} worry, {{ he(Gerin) }} talked of the capital and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own two years there. {{Elise}} was a good audience, as city life of any sort was new to {{ her(Elise) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} told a couple of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} better stories. {{ Herd(Elise) }} laugh warmed the cool evening. {{ She(Elise) }} moved closer to {{ him(Gerin) }}, eager to hear more.
{{ He(Gerin) }} leaned over and kissed {{ her(Elise) }}. It seemed the most natural thing in the world to do. For a moment, {{ herd(Elise) }} lips were startled and still under {{ hisd(Gerin) }}. Then {{ she(Elise) }} returned the kiss, at first hesitantly, then with a warmth to match {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own.
You do have a gift for complicating your life, {{ he(Gerin) }} told {{ himself(Gerin) }} as {{ she(Elise) }} snuggled {{ herd(Elise) }} head into {{ hisd(Gerin) }} shoulder. If things go on the way they've started, not only will {{Wolfar}} want to cut out your heart and eat it (a project {{ he(Gerin) }}'s been nursing quite a while anyhow), but your old friend {{Ricolf}} will be convinced—note or no note—you ran off with {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} {{ daughter(Elise) }} for reasons having very little to do with taking {{ her(Elise) }} to {{ herd(Elise) }} {{ uncle(Valdabrun) }}. And what is {{ she(Elise) }} thinking? {{ She(Elise) }}'s no peasant {{ wench(Elise) }}, to be honored by a tumble and then forgotten. And further . . .
A plague on it all, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought. {{ He(Gerin) }} kissed {{ herd(Elise) }} again.
But when {{ hisd(Gerin) }} lips touched {{ herd(Elise) }} soft white throat and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hands moved to slide inside {{ herd(Elise) }} tunic, {{ she(Elise) }} asked {{ him(Gerin) }} softly, "Was it for this, then, you decided to bring me south? Have I traded one {{Wolfar}} for another?" {{ She(Elise) }} tried to keep {{ herd(Elise) }} tone light, but hurt and disappointment were in {{ herd(Elise) }} voice. They stopped {{ him(Gerin) }} effectively as a dagger drawn, perhaps more so. {{ She(Elise) }} slipped free of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} encircling arm.
Breath whistled through {{ hisd(Gerin) }} nostrils as {{ he(Gerin) }} brought {{ hisd(Gerin) }} body back under mind's rein. "I would never have you think that," {{ he(Gerin) }} said.
"Nor do I, in truth," {{ she(Elise) }} replied, but the hurt was still there. The time to remember {{ he(Gerin) }} was {{ man(Gerin) }} and {{ she(Elise) }} {{ maid(Elise) }} might come later, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought. It was not here yet, despite the cool quiet of the night and the moonlight filtering through the trees.
{{ She(Elise) }} was silent so long {{ he(Gerin) }} thought {{ her(Elise) }} still upset, but when {{ he(Gerin) }} framed further apologies, {{ she(Elise) }} waved them away. They talked of inconsequential things for a little while. Then {{ she(Elise) }} rose and walked to the wagon for {{ herd(Elise) }} bedroll. As {{ she(Elise) }} passed {{ him(Gerin) }}, {{ she(Elise) }} stooped; {{ herd(Elise) }} lips brushed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} cheek.
{{ Hisd(Gerin) }} mind was still thought-filled long after {{ she(Elise) }} had fallen asleep. Elleb's thick waxing crescent was well set and the nearly full Math, bright as a golden coin, beginning to wester when {{ he(Gerin) }} woke Van and sank into exhausted slumber.
{{ Hisd(Gerin) }} dreams at first were murky, filled now with the aurochs, now with {{Elise}}. {{ He(Gerin) }} remembered little of them. {{ He(Gerin) }} rarely did, and thought strange those who could recall their dreams and cast omens from them. But then it was as if a gale arose within {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sleeping mind and blew away the mists separating {{ him(Gerin) }} from the country of dreams.
Clear as if {{ he(Gerin) }} had been standing on the spot, {{ he(Gerin) }} saw the great watchfires flame, heard wild music of pipe, horn, and harp skirl up to the sky, saw tall northern warriors gathered by the fires, some with spears, others with drinking-horns in their hands. This is no common dream, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought, and felt fear, but {{ he(Gerin) }} could not leave it, not even when black wings drowned {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sight in darkness.
Those proved to be the edges of the {{ wizard(Balamung) }}'s cloak {{Balamung}} wore. The {{ sorcerer(Balamung) }} stepped back a pace, to be silhouetted against the firelight like a bird of prey. Only {{ hisd(Balamung) }} eyes were live things, embers of scarlet and amber set in {{ hisd(Balamung) }} gaunt face.
The barbarian mage was only too aware of the Fox. {{ He(Balamung) }} turned a trifle and bowed a hate-filled bow, as if the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had been there in the flesh. The light played redly off {{ hisd(Balamung) }} hollow cheeks. {{ He(Balamung) }} said, "{{ Lord(Gerin)}} {{Gerin}} the Fox, it's no less than a nuisance you are to me, no less, so I pray you'll forgive my costing you a dollop of sleep to show you what's waiting in the northlands whilst you scuttle about the filthy south. Would I could be drawing the black-hearted soul of you from your carcass, but there's no spell I ken to do it, what with you so far away."
No spell {{Gerin}} knew could have reached across the miles at all. {{ He(Balamung) }} was nothing, not even a wraith, just eyes and ears bound to see and hear only what {{Balamung}} chose to reveal.
The Trokmoi danced round the fires, tossing swords, spears, aye, and drinking-horns, too, into the air. The {{ baron(Gerin) }}'s disembodied spirit was less terrified than it might have been; the dance was one of those {{Rihwin}} had performed atop {{Ricolf}}'s table. It seemed an age ago. But {{Balamung}} surely knew the {{ baron(Gerin) }} expected {{ him(Gerin) }} to arm for war. What else had {{ he(Gerin) }} been summoned to see?
{{Balamung}} called down curses on the Fox's head. {{ He(Gerin) }} hoped they would not bite deep. On and on the {{ wizard(Balamung) }} ranted, until {{ he(Balamung) }} paused to draw breath. Then {{ he(Balamung) }} went on more calmly, saying, "Not least do I mislike you for costing me the soul of a fine fighter this day. Like a wee bird I sent it flitting out, to light in the body of the great aurochs. Sure as sure I was the beast'd stomp you to flinders and leave you dead by the side of the road. Curse your tricky soul, how did you escape? The fighter’s spirit died trapped in the beast, for I could not draw it free in time. And when it flickered away, the body was forfeit too, poor wight."
No wonder the bull had trailed {{ him(Gerin) }} with such grim intensity! Maybe {{ he(Gerin) }}'d been right when {{ he(Gerin) }} thought its eyes were green, there in the meadow; that might have been some byproduct of {{Balamung}}'s magic. {{ He(Gerin) }} had been lucky indeed.
"But sure and I'll have my revenge!" {{Balamung}} screamed. Behind {{ him(Balamung) }}, the music had fallen silent. The dancers stood motionless and expectant.
The spell the mage used must have been readied beforehand, for when {{ he(Balamung) }} cried out in the harsh Kizzuwatnan tongue a stout wicker cage rose from the ground and drifted slowly toward the fire. {{Gerin}}'s spirit quailed when {{ he(Gerin) }} saw it; {{ he(Gerin) }} knew the Trokmoi burned their criminals alive, and in this cage, too, a {{ man(Divico) }} struggled vainly to free {{ himself(Divico) }}.
"Die, traitor, die!" {{Balamung}} shouted. All the gathered warriors took up the cry. Horror rose in {{Gerin}}, who suddenly recognized the condemned prisoner. It was {{Divico}}, the Trokmê chieftain whose life {{ he(Gerin) }} had spared at Ikos. {{ He(Gerin) }} wished sickly that {{ he(Gerin) }} had let Van give the northerner a clean death. "Have a look at what befalls them who fight me," {{Balamung}} whispered, "for your turn is next!" {{ Hisd(Balamung) }} voice was cold as ice, harsh as stone.
And while {{ he(Balamung) }} spoke, the cage entered the blaze. Some minor magic had proofed the wicker against flame; no fire would hold on it. But wherever a tongue licked {{Divico}}, it clung, flaring as brightly as if {{ hisd(Divico) }} body were a pitch-soaked torch.
Held there by {{Balamung}}'s wizardry, {{Gerin}} watched in dread as the flames boiled {{Divico}}'s eyeballs in {{ hisd(Divico) }} head, melted {{ hisd(Divico) }} ears into shapeless lumps of meat that sagged and ran against {{ hisd(Divico) }} cheeks, then charred the flesh from those cheeks to leave white bone staring through. Fire cavorted over the Trokmê's body, but {{Balamung}}'s evil magic would not let {{ him(Divico) }} die. {{ He(Divico) }} fought against the unyielding door until {{ hisd(Divico) }} very tendons burned away. {{ Hisd(Divico) }} shrieks had stopped long before, when flames swallowed {{ hisd(Divico) }} larynx.
"{{ He(Divico) }} was a job I had to rush," {{Balamung}} said. "When it's you, now, Fox, falling into my hand, I'll take the time to think up something truly worthy of you, oh indeed and I will!" {{ He(Balamung) }} made a gesture of dismissal. {{Gerin}} found {{ himself(Gerin) }} staring up from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bedroll, body wet with cold sweat.
"Bad dream, captain?" Van asked.
{{Gerin}}'s only answer was a grunt. {{ He(Gerin) }} was too shaken for coherent speech. {{Divico}}'s face, eaten by flames, still stood before {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eyes, more vivid than the dimly lit campsite {{ he(Gerin) }} really saw. {{ He(Gerin) }} thought {{ he(Gerin) }} would never want to sleep again, but {{ hisd(Gerin) }} weary body needed rest more than {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind feared it.
The sounds of a scuffle woke {{ him(Gerin) }}. Before {{ he(Gerin) }} could do more than open {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eyes, strong hands pinned {{ him(Gerin) }} to the ground. It was still far from sunrise. Did bandits in the southland dare the darkness, or was this some new assault of {{Balamung}}'s? {{ He(Gerin) }} twisted, trying to lever {{ himself(Gerin) }} up on an elbow and see who or what had overcome {{ him(Gerin) }}.
"Be still, or I'll rend thee where thou liest." The voice was soft, tender, {{ female(Mavrix) }}, and altogether mad. More hands, all full of casual deranged strength, pressed down {{ hisd(Gerin) }} legs. They tugged warningly. {{ He(Gerin) }} felt {{ hisd(Gerin) }} joints creak.
All hope left {{ him(Gerin) }}. After {{ he(Gerin) }} had escaped {{Balamung}}'s forays, it seemed unfair for {{ him(Gerin) }} to die under the tearing hands of the votaries of {{Mavrix}}. Why had the wine-{{ god(Mavrix) }}'s orgiastic, frenzied cult ever spread outside {{ hisd(Mavrix) }} native Sithonia?
Moving very slowly, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} turned {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head, trying to see the extent of the disaster. Perhaps one of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} comrades had managed to get away. But no: in the moonlight {{ he(Gerin) }} saw Van, {{ hisd(Van) }} vast muscles twisting and knotting to no avail, pinned by more of the madwomen. Still more had fastened themselves to {{Elise}}.
The maenads' eyes reflected the firelight like those of so many wolves. That was the only light in them. They held no human intelligence or mercy, for they were filled by the madness of the {{ god(Mavrix) }}. The finery in which they had begun their trek through the woods was ripped and tattered and splashed with mud and grime, their hair awry and full of twigs. One {{ woman(Mavrix) }}, plainly a {{ lady(Mavrix) }} of high station from the remnants of fine linen draped about {{ herd(Mavrix) }} body, clutched the mangled corpse of some small animal to {{ herd(Mavrix) }} bosom, crooning over and over, "My baby, my baby."
A blue light drifted out of the forest, a shining nimbus round a figure . . . godlike was the only word for it, {{Gerin}} thought. "What have we here?" the figure asked, voice deep and sweet like the drink the desert nomads brewed to keep off sleep.
"{{Mavrix}}!" the {{ women(Mavrix) }} breathed, their faces slack with ecstasy. {{Gerin}} felt their hands quiver and slip. {{ He(Gerin) }} braced {{ himself(Gerin) }} for a surge, but even as {{ he(Gerin) }} tensed the {{ god(Mavrix) }} waved and the grip on {{ him(Gerin) }} tightened again.
"What have we here?" {{Mavrix}} repeated.
Van gave a grunt of surprise. "How is it you speak my language?"
To the Fox it had been Elabonian. "{{ He(Mavrix) }}didn't—" The protest died half-spoken as {{ hisd(Gerin) }} captors snarled.
The {{ god(Mavrix) }} made an airy, effeminate gesture. "We have our ways," {{ he(Mavrix) }} said . . . and suddenly there were two of {{ him(Mavrix) }}, standing side by side. They—he—gestured again, and there was only one.
As well as {{ he(Mavrix) }} could, {{Gerin}} studied Mavrix. The {{ god(Mavrix) }} wore fawnskin, soft and supple, with a wreath of grape leaves round {{ hisd(Mavrix) }} brow. In {{ hisd(Mavrix) }} left hand {{ he(Mavrix) }} bore an ivy-tipped wand. At need, {{Gerin}} knew, it was a weapon more deadly than any mortal's spear. Mavrix's blond curls reached {{ hisd(Mavrix) }} shoulder; {{ hisd(Mavrix) }} cheeks and chin sharp. That soft-featured, smiling face was a pederast's dream, but for the eyes: two black pits reflecting nothing, giving back only the night. A faint odor of fermenting grapes and something else, a rank something {{Gerin}} could not name, clung to {{ him(Mavrix) }}.
"That must be a useful art." The {{ baron(Gerin) }} spoke in halting Sithonian, trying to pique the {{ god(Mavrix) }}'s interest and buy at least a few extra minutes of life.
Mavrix turned those fathomless eyes on the Fox, but {{ hisd(Mavrix) }} face was still a smiling mask. {{ He(Mavrix) }} answered in the same tongue: "How pleasant to hear the true speech once more, albeit in the mouth of a victim," and {{Gerin}} knew {{ hisd(Gerin) }} doom.
"Are you in league with {{Balamung}}, then?" {{ he(Gerin) }} growled, knowing nothing {{ he(Gerin) }} said now could hurt {{ him(Gerin) }} further.
"I, friend to some fribbling barbarian charlatan? What care I for such things? But surely, friend mortal, you see this is your fate. The madness of the Mavriad cannot, must not be thwarted. Were it so, the festival would have no meaning, for what is it but the ultimate negation of all the petty nonfulfillments of humdrum, everyday life?"
"It's not right!" {{Elise}} burst out. "Dying I can understand; everyone dies, soon or late. But after the {{ baron(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}"—the Fox thought it a poor time to rhyme, but kept quiet—"singlehanded slew the aurochs, to die at the hands of lunatics, {{ god(Mavrix) }}-driven or no—"
Mavrix broke in, deep voice cracking: "{{Gerin}} slew a great wild ox—" The {{ god(Mavrix) }}'s smile gave way to an expression of purest horror. "The oxgoad come again!" {{ he(Mavrix) }} screamed, "but now in the shape of a {{ man(Gerin) }}! Metokhites, I thought you slain!" With a final despairing shriek, the {{ god(Mavrix) }} vanished into the depths of the woods. {{ Hisd(Mavrix) }} followers fled after, afflicted by {{ hisd(Mavrix) }} terror—all but the {{ lady(Mavrix) }} of rank, who still sat contentedly, rocking {{ herd(Mavrix) }} gruesome "baby."
Still amazed at being alive, {{Gerin}} slowly sat up. So did {{Elise}} and Van, both wearing bewildered expressions. "What did I say?" {{Elise}} asked.
{{Gerin}} thumped {{ hisd(Gerin) }} forehead, trying to jar loose a memory. {{ He(Gerin) }} had paid scant attention to Mavrix in the past, as the {{ god(Mavrix) }}'s principal manifestations, wine and the grape, were rare north of the Kirs. "I have it!" {{ he(Gerin) }} said at last, snapping {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fingers. "This Metokhites was a Sithonian {{ prince(Gerin) }} long ago. Once {{ he(Gerin) }} chased the {{ god(Mavrix) }} into the Lesser Inner Sea, beating {{ him(Mavrix) }} about the head with a metal-tipped oxgoad: Mavrix always was a coward. I suppose {{ he(Mavrix) }} thought I was a new—what would the word be?—incarnation of {{ hisd(Mavrix) }} tormentor."
"What happened to this Metokhites {{ fellow(Gerin) }}?" Van asked. "It's not the smartest thing, tangling with gods."
"As I remember, {{ he(Gerin) }} chopped {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ son(Gerin) }} into bloody bits, being under the impression the {{ lad(Gerin) }} was a grapevine."
"A grapevine, you say? Well, captain, if I ever seem to you to go all green and leafy-like, be so good as to warn me before you try to trim me."
At that, the last of the maenads lifted {{ herd(Mavrix) }} eyes from the ruined little body {{ she(Mavrix) }} dandled. There was a beginning of knowledge in {{ herd(Mavrix) }} face, though {{ she(Mavrix) }} was not yet fully aware of {{ herself(Mavrix) }} or {{ herd(Mavrix) }} surroundings. {{ Herd(Mavrix) }} voice had some of the authority of the {{Sibyl}} at Ikos when {{ she(Mavrix) }} spoke: "Mock not Mavrix, {{ lord(Mavrix) }} of the sweet grape. Rest assured, you are not forgotten!" Gathering {{ herd(Mavrix) }} rags about {{ her(Mavrix) }}, {{ she(Mavrix) }} swept imperiously into the woods. Silence fell on the camp.
<h2>VII</h2>
Taking advantage of the quiet of the ghosts, {{Gerin}} decided to leave at once, though {{ he(Gerin) }} knew mere distance was even less guarantee of safety from {{Mavrix}} than from {{Balamung}}. No thunderbolt smote {{ him(Gerin) }}. Before too much time had passed, the rising sun turned Tiwaz and Math to a pair of pale gleams hanging close together in the southern sky.
So full of events had the previous day been that the Fox took till mid-afternoon to remember {{ hisd(Gerin) }} dream, if such it was. By that time they were on the main road again, three more corpuscles among the thousands flowing toward the Empire’s heart. “So that’s why you woke with such a thrash!” Van said. Then the full import of the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s words sank in. “You’re saying the scrawny {{ son(Balamung) }} of nobody knows where we are and what we’re up to?”
{{Gerin}} rubbed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} chin. “Where we are, anyway.”
“I’m not sure I like that.”
“I know damned well I don’t, but what can I do about it?”
The Fox spent a gloomy, watchful night, fearing a return visit from {{Mavrix}}. The oracular tones of the {{ god(Mavrix) }}’s half-crazed worshiper had left {{ him(Gerin) }} jittery. The watch was lonely, too. Van fell asleep at once, and {{Elise}} quickly followed {{ him(Van) }}.
That day on the road, {{ she(Elise) }} had hardly spoken to the {{ baron(Gerin) }}. {{ She(Elise) }} spent most of {{ herd(Elise) }} time listening to Van’s yarns; {{ he(Van) }} would cheerfully spin them for hours on end. {{ She(Elise) }} gave {{Gerin}} nothing more than cool courtesy when {{ he(Gerin) }} tried to join the conversation. At length {{ he(Gerin) }} subsided, feeling isolated and vaguely betrayed. The left side of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mouth quirked up in a sour smile; {{ he(Gerin) }} knew only too well that {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ill-timed ardor was what made {{ her(Elise) }} wary.
The new morning began much as the day before had ended: {{Gerin}} and {{Elise}} cautious and elaborately polite while Van, who seemed oblivious to the tension around {{ him(Van) }}, bawled out a bawdy tune {{ he(Van) }} had learned from the Trokmoi. So it went till they reached the Pranther River, another of the streams that rose in the foothills of the Kirs and ended by swelling the waters of the Greater Inner Sea.
The road did not falter at the Pranther, but sprang over it on a bridge supported by eight pillars of stone. The span itself was of stout timbers, which could be removed at need to slow invaders. This bridge was no flimsy magician’s trick—it looked ready to stand for a thousand years.
Van gazed at it with admiration. “What a fine thing! It beats getting your backside wet, any day.”
“It’s probably the most famous bridge in the Empire,” {{Gerin}} told him, grinning; the bridge over the Pranther was one of his favorite places in the south. “It’s called {{Dalassenos}}’ Revenge.”
“Why’s that, captain?”
“{{Dalassenos}} was Oren the Builder’s chief architect. {{ He(Dalassenos) }} was the {{ fellow(Dalassenos) }} who designed this bridge, but Oren wanted only his own name on it. Being a Sithonian, {{Dalassenos}} didn’t have much use for the {{Emperor}} in the first place, and that was too much to bear. So {{ he(Dalassenos) }} carved {{ hisd(Dalassenos) }} own message into the rock, then put a coat of plaster over it and chiseled Oren’s name in that. After a few years, the plaster peeled away and—well, see for yourself.” {{ He(Gerin) }} jerked a thumb at the pylon.
“It’s only so many scratches to me. I don’t read Sithonian, or much else, for that matter.”
{{Gerin}} thought for a moment. “As near as I can put it into Elabonian, it says:
‘The plaster above? ’Twas nought but a farce,
And as for {{ King(Emperor) }} Oren, {{ he(Emperor) }} can kiss my arse.’”
Van bellowed laughter. “Ho, ho! That calls for a snort.” A blind reach into the back of the wagon brought {{ him(Van) }} {{ hisd(Van) }} quarry—a wineskin. {{ He(Van) }} swigged noisily.
{{Dalassenos}}’ flip insolence also earned the Fox a smile from {{Elise}}; {{ herd(Elise) }} appreciation was worth more to {{ him(Gerin) }} than Van’s chuckles. “What happened to {{Dalassenos}} when the plaster wore off?” {{ she(Elise) }} asked. The friendly interest in {{ herd(Elise) }} voice told {{Gerin}} {{ he(Gerin) }} had been forgiven.
“Not a thing,” {{ he(Gerin) }} answered. “It lasted through Oren’s life, and {{ he(Emperor) }} died childless ({{ he(Emperor) }} liked {{ boys(Emperor) }}). {{ Hisd(Emperor) }} successor hated {{ him(Emperor) }} for almost bankrupting the Empire with all {{ hisd(Emperor) }} building, and likely laughed {{ hisd(Emperor) }} head off when {{ he(Emperor) }} learned what {{Dalassenos}} had done. I know {{ he(Emperor) }} sent {{Dalassenos}} a pound of gold, tight though {{ he(Emperor) }} was.”
As they passed over the bridge, {{Gerin}} looked down into the Pranther’s clear water. A green manlike shape caught {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eye. It was so close to the surface that {{ he(Gerin) }} could easily see the four scarlet gill-slits on either side of its neck.
The Pranther held the only colony of rivermen west of the Greater Inner Sea. {{Dalassenos}} had brought the reptiles here from their native Sithonian streams. The canny artificer knew stones and sand propelled by the Pranther’s current would eventually scour away the riverbottom from under {{ hisd(Dalassenos) }} bridge’s pilings and bring it tumbling down. Hence the rivermen: they repaired such damage as fast as it occurred.
In exchange, the Empire banned humans from fishing in the Pranther, and gave the rivermen leave to enforce the prohibition with their poisoned darts. It was also said that {{Dalassenos}} had hired a {{ wizard(wizard2) }} to put a spell of permanent plenty on the fish. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} did not know about that, but the rivermen had flourished in the Pranther for more than three hundred years.
{{Gerin}} heard the screech of an eagle overhead. Shielding {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eyes from the sun, {{ he(Gerin) }} looked up into morning haze until {{ he(Gerin) }} found it. It wheeled in the sky, sun striking sparks from its ruddy plumage. Its feathers, {{ he(Gerin) }} mused, were red as a Trokmê’s mustache.
Sudden suspicion flared in {{ him(Gerin) }} as {{ he(Gerin) }} realized what {{ he(Gerin) }}’d thought. “Van, do you think you can bring me down that overgrown pigeon?” {{ he(Gerin) }} asked, knowing {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend’s mighty arms could propel a shaft farther than most dreamed possible.
The outlander squinted upward, shook {{ his(Van) }} head. “No more than I could flap my arms and fly to Fomor.”
“Fomor, is it?”
“Tiwaz, I mean. Whatever fool name you give the quick moon.”
“Two years with me, and you still talk like a Trokmê.” {{Gerin}} sadly shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head.
“Go howl, captain. What’s in your mind?” The Fox did not answer. {{ He(Gerin) }} pulled the wagon off the road. The eagle gave no sign of flying away, nor had {{ he(Gerin) }} expected any. {{ He(Gerin) }} had never seen a red eagle, and was convinced it was some creature of {{Balamung}}’s, a flying spy. {{ He(Gerin) }} climbed down from the wagon and began to root among the bushes by the roadside.
“What are you looking for, {{Gerin}}?” {{Elise}} asked.
“Sneezeweed,” {{ he(Gerin) }} answered, not finding any. {{ He(Gerin) }} muttered a curse. The plant was a rank pest near Fox Keep; it grew everywhere in the northlands, even invading wheatfields. When it flowered, those sensitive to its pollen went into a season-long agony of wheezing, sneezing, runny eyes, and puffy faces. The dried pollen was also a first-rate itching powder, as small {{ boys(Gerin) }} soon learned. The Fox remembered a thrashing {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ brother(Dagref) }} {{Dagref}} had given {{ him(Gerin) }} over a pair of sneezeweed-impregnated breeches
At last {{ he(Gerin) }} found a ragged sneezeweed plant huddling under two bigger bushes, its shiny, dark green leaves sadly bug-eaten. {{ He(Gerin) }} murmured a prayer of thanks to {{Dyaus}} when {{ he(Gerin) }} saw a spike of pink flowers still clinging to it. It would serve for the small magic {{ he(Gerin) }} had in mind.
{{ He(Gerin) }} ran the spell over and over in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head, hoping {{ he(Gerin) }} still had it memorized. It was simple enough, and one all ‘prentices learned—a fine joke on the unwary. At the Sorcerers’ Collegium, one quickly learned not to be unwary.
{{ He(Gerin)}} held the spray of sneezeweed flowers in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} left hand and began to chant. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} right hand moved through the few simple passes the spell required. It took less than a minute. When it was done, {{ he(Gerin) }} looked up and awaited developments.
For a moment, nothing happened. {{ He(Gerin) }} wondered if {{ he(Gerin) }} had botched the incantation or if it simply was not strong enough to reach the high-flying eagle. Then the bird seemed to stagger in mid-flight. Its head darted under its wing to peck furiously. No longer could it maintain its effortless rhythm through the air, but fought without success to maintain altitude. It descended in an ungainly spiral, screaming its rage all the while, and flopped into the bushes about twenty paces from the wagon. Van put an arrow through it. It died still snapping at the shaft.
Much pleased with {{ himself(Gerin) }}, the Fox trotted over to collect the carcass. {{ He(Gerin) }} had just brought it to the wagon when {{Elise}} cried out in warning. Two more red eagles were diving out of the morning sky, stooping like falcons. Van had time for one hasty shot. {{ He(Van) }} missed. Cursing foully, {{ he(Gerin) }} snatched up the whip and swung it in a terrible arc. It smashed into one bird with a sound like a thunderclap. Feathers flew in a metallic cloud. The eagle gave a despairing screech and tumbled to the roadway.
The other one flew into {{Gerin}}'s surprised arms.
It fastened its claw on the leather sleeve of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} corselet, seeming to think the garment part of its owner. The Fox plunged {{ hisd(Gerin) }} free hand at its shining breast, trying to keep its bill from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eyes. It screamed and bucked, buffeting {{ him(Gerin) }} with vile-smelling wings.
There was a crunch. Van drove the butt end of the whip into the eagle’s head, again and again. The mad gleam in its golden eyes faded. {{Gerin}} slowly realized {{ he(Gerin) }} was holding a dead weight. Blood trickled down {{ hisd(Gerin) }} arm; that leather sleeve had not altogether protected {{ him(Gerin) }}.
A gleam of silver caught {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eye. The bird wore a tiny button at its throat, held on by a fine chain. The button bore only one mark: a fylfot. “{{Balamung}}, sure enough,” {{Gerin}} muttered.
Van peered at it over {{ hisd(Gerin) }} shoulder. “Let me have a closer look at that, will you?” {{ he(Van) }} said. {{Gerin}} slipped the chain from the dead eagle’s neck and passed it to {{ him(Van) }}. {{ He(Van) }} hefted it thoughtfully. “Lighter than it should be.” {{ He(Van) }} squeezed it between thumb and finger, grunting at the effort. “Gives a little, but not enough.” {{ He(Van) }} brought down a booted foot club-fashion. There was a thin, hissing wail. {{Gerin}} gagged. {{ He(Gerin) }} thought of latrines, of new-dug graves fresh uncovered, of scummed moats, of long slow evils fermenting deep in the bowels of swamps and oozing upwards to burst as slimy bubbles.
The body in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} arms writhed, though {{ he(Gerin) }} knew it was, knew it had to be, dead. {{ He(Gerin) }} looked down, and dropped {{ hisd(Gerin) }} burden with an exclamation of horror. No longer was the  corpse that of an eagle, but of a Trokmê, {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} head battered to a pulp, fiery locks soaked in blood. But … the broken body was no bigger than the bird had been. Grim-faced, {{ he(Gerin) }} and Van repeated the grisly experiment twice more, each time with the same result.
As {{ he(Gerin) }} buried the three tiny bodies in a common grave, the pride {{ he(Gerin) }} had felt in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sorcerous talent drained away like wine from a broken cup. What good were {{ hisd(Gerin) }} little skills against such power as {{Balamung}} possessed, power that could rob humans of their very shapes and send them winging over hundreds of miles to slay at {{ hisd(Balamung) }} bidding?
{{Elise}} said, “It will take a mighty southern mage indeed to overcome such strength.” {{ Herd(Elise) }} voice was somber, but somehow {{ herd(Elise) }} words, instead of depressing the {{ baron(Gerin) }}, lifted {{ hisd(Gerin) }} spirits. They reminded {{ him(Gerin) }} {{ he(Gerin) }} would not, after all, have to face {{Balamung}} alone. More and more, their conflict was assuming in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind the nature of a duel between {{ himself(Gerin) }} and the northern {{ wizard(Balamung) }}, a duel in which the Trokmê owned most of the weapons. But why was {{ he(Gerin) }} here in the southlands, if not for allies?
“You have a gift for saying the right thing,” {{ he(Gerin) }} told {{ her(Elise) }} gratefully. {{ She(Elise) }} shook {{ herd(Elise) }} head in pretty confusion. {{ He(Gerin) }} did not explain. As the day wore on, {{ he(Gerin) }} felt better and better. True, {{Balamung}} had tried to slay {{ him(Gerin) }} from afar, but twice now {{ hisd(Balamung) }} efforts had come to nothing, and every hour put more miles between {{ him(Balamung) }} and {{ hisd(Balamung) }} quarry.
Late in the afternoon, Van pointed to a hand-sized roadside shrub not much different from its neighbors and said, “You know some plant-lore, {{Gerin}}—there’s another useful plant for you.”
“That?” the Fox said. “It looks like any other weed to me.”
“Then you Elabonians don’t know what to do with it. It grows out on the plains of Shanda, too. The shamans there call it ‘aoratos,’ which means it lets you see a bit of the unseen when you chew the leaves. Not only that, they help keep you awake on watch. Like I said, a useful plant.”
“What do you mean, ‘it lets you see a bit of the unseen’?”
“That’s the only way I can explain it, captain. Hold up a moment, and I’ll let you see for yourself.” Van uprooted the little bush and returned to the wagon. {{Gerin}} studied the plant curiously, but it was so nondescript {{ he(Gerin) }} could not say whether {{ he(Gerin) }} had seen its like before.
{{ He(Gerin) }} got to test its properties soon enough, for {{ he(Gerin) }} drew first watch that night. The leaves were gritty and bitter. Their juice burned as {{ he(Gerin) }} swallowed. Little by little, {{ he(Gerin) }} felt {{ hisd(Gerin) }} tiredness slip away. As {{ he(Gerin) }} sat sentinel, the night came alive around {{ him(Gerin) }}.
The sky seemed to darken; Elleb, just past first quarter, shone with spectral clarity. So, when {{ she(Elleb) }} rose, did Math, a day past full. The stars also seemed very bright and clear.
But that was the least effect of the aoratos plant. The Fox found {{ he(Gerin) }} could tell with certainty where every live thing lurked within a hundred yards of the fire. No matter how well concealed it was, its life force impinged on {{ him(Gerin) }} like a spot of light seen in the back of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind.
{{ He(Gerin) }} understood why Van had had trouble talking about the experience—it seemed to use a sense {{ hisd(Gerin) }} body did not normally employ. {{ He(Gerin) }} was even able to detect strange patterns of radiance within the ghosts, though their flickering shapes remained indistinct as ever.
The extra perception gradually faded, and was gone well before midnight. On the whole, {{ he(Gerin) }} decided, {{ he(Gerin) }} approved of the aoratos plant. If nothing else, it made ambushes nearly impossible. “Aye, it does that,” Van nodded when {{Gerin}} told {{ him(Van) }} of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} feelings,
Nor did they find another aoratos bush the following day, or the next, or the next. The last of its leaves stripped, the little plant was tossed away and all but forgotten. As the road swung east, down into the great plain whose heart was Elabon’s capital, {{Gerin}} found {{ he(Gerin) }} had more important things to think about. The dry warmth of the south, the quality of the sunlight pouring down from the sky, and the bustling people of the ever more numerous towns were calling forth a side of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} nature {{ he(Gerin) }} had had to hide on the frontier, a gentler side {{ hisd(Gerin) }} vassals would only have construed as weakness.
{{Drago}} or {{Rollan}} could never have understood {{ hisd(Gerin) }} open admiration of a sunset; {{ hisd(Gerin) }} search for verses from Lekapenos appropriate to its beauty; {{ hisd(Gerin) }} easy, friendly dealing with merchants and innkeepers, those at whom they would simply have barked orders. {{ He(Gerin) }} felt like a flower, half of whose petals were seeing the sun for the first time in years.
The presence of {{Elise}} beside {{ him(Gerin) }} was a pleasant pain. {{ She(Elise) }} unsettled {{ him(Gerin) }} more than {{ he(Gerin) }} was willing to admit, even to {{ himself(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} was too conscious of {{ her(Elise) }} as a {{ woman(Elise) }} to bring back all the ease of talk they had once enjoyed. {{ She(Elise) }} stayed warm and friendly, but deftly avoided anything truly personal, seeming content with the inconclusive status quo. {{ Herd(Elise) }} warmth extended farther than the Fox, too; {{ herd(Elise) }} laughing responses to Van’s outrageous flirtation grated on {{Gerin}}'s nerves.
Two days out from the capital, the travelers found lodging at a tavern in a little town called Cormilia. The {{ lass(lover1) }} who served them there was short, dark, and, though a bit plump, quite pretty; a tiny mole on {{ herd(lover1) }} right cheek made {{ herd(lover1) }} round face piquant.
Something about {{ her(lover1) }} struck the Fox’s fancy. When {{ he(lover1) }} raised an eyebrow at {{ her(lover1) }}, {{ she(lover1) }} winked back saucily. {{ He(Gerin) }} was not surprised when {{ she(lover1) }} tapped at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} door later that night. While {{ herd(lover1) }} thighs clasped {{ him(Gerin) }}, {{ she(lover1) }} seemed hot-blooded enough for any {{ man(Gerin) }}’s taste. But {{ herd(lover1) }} ministrations, immensely pleasant in the moment, somehow left {{ him(Gerin) }} less than satisfied after {{ she(lover1) }} slipped away.
{{ He(Gerin) }} knew {{ he(Gerin) }} had pleased {{ her(lover1) }}. {{ Herd(lover1) }} adoring manner the next morning spoke of how much. But the coupling only showed {{ him(Gerin) }} the emptiness within {{ himself(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} was preoccupied and curt, and breakfasted without much noticing what {{ he(Gerin) }} ate.
When {{ he(Gerin) }} and Van went out to the stable to hitch up the horses, {{ he(Gerin) }} blurted, “You know, when {{Dyaus}} created {{ women(Elise) }} {{ he(Dyaus) }} must have been in a fey mood. You can’t live with them and sure as sure can’t live without them.”
Though surmise gleamed in Van’s eye, {{ he(Van) }} said nothing to that. {{ He(Van) }} knew {{Gerin}} was a {{ man(Gerin) }} who had to work things through in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own mind and often thought advice interference.
A briny breeze from the Greater Inner Sea blew all day. They might have made the capital by evening. But {{Gerin}} did not relish trying in the dark to find {{ hisd(Gerin) }} old friend Turgis’ inn; the great city’s maze of streets was bad enough by day.
The coming parting with {{Elise}} also wrenched {{ him(Gerin) }} more each mile {{ he(Gerin) }} traveled. {{ He(Gerin) }} was far from eager to speed it unduly. {{ He(Gerin) }} decided to camp just in front of the last low ridge shielding the capital from sight. As darkness fell, the city’s lights put a glow on the eastern horizon and bleached fainter stars from the sky.
In an area so densely peopled, night travel was no longer unthinkable. A brightly lit convoy of wagons and chariots rumbled past the campsite every few minutes, often with a mumbling {{ priest(priest) }} to help ward off the spirits.
Of this Van heard nothing, for {{ he(Van) }} fell asleep almost instantly. But {{Gerin}} did not pass {{ hisd(Gerin) }} watch in lonely contemplation. For the first time since the night Mavrix appeared, {{Elise}} decided to stay up a while and talk. The reason soon became clear: {{ she(Elise) }} was bubbling over with excitement and curiosity about the capital and the family in it {{ she(Elise) }} had never seen.
{{ She(Elise) }} gushed on for a time, then stopped, embarrassed. “But this is terrible! What a loon I am! Here I play the magpie over all I’ll see and do in the city, and not a word of thanks to you, who brought me here safe through so many troubles. What must you think of me?”
The answer to that had been slowly forming in the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s mind ever since {{ he(Gerin) }} helped {{ her(Elise) }} slip from {{Ricolf}}’s keep. {{ Herd(Elise) }} rhetorical question but served to bring it into sharper focus. {{ He(Gerin) }} replied hesitantly, though, for fear of {{ her(Elise) }} thinking {{ he(Gerin) }} was abusing the privilege their companionship had given {{ him(Gerin) }}. “It’s simple enough,” {{ he(Gerin) }} said at last, taking the plunge—the thought of losing {{ her(Elise) }} forever filled {{ him(Gerin) }} with more dread than any Trokmê horde. “After {{Balamung}} and {{ hisd(Balamung) }} woodsrunners are driven back to the forests where they belong, nothing would make me happier than coming south again so I can court you properly.”
{{ He(Gerin) }} did not know what reaction {{ he(Gerin) }} had expected from {{ her(Elise) }}—certainly not the glad acceptance {{ she(Elise) }} showed. “As things are now, I cannot say as much as I would like,” {{ she(Elise) }} said, “but nothing would please me more.” {{ Herd(Elise) }} lips met {{ his(Gerin) }} in a gentle kiss that gave {{ him(Gerin) }} more contentment than all {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sweaty exertions the night before in Cormilia. {{ She(Elise) }} went on, “Foolish {{ man(Gerin) }}, did you not know I cried last year when I learned your wound would keep you from coming to my {{ father(Ricolff) }}’s holding?”
{{ He(Gerin) }} held {{ her(Elise) }} close, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind filling with a hundred, a thousand foolish plans for the future. The rest of the watch flew by like a dream, as it would have for any lover who suddenly found {{ hisd(Gerin) }} love returned. If {{Balamung}}’s gaunt figure stood like a jagged reef between {{ him(Gerin) }} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} dreams, on this night {{ he(Gerin) }} would pretend {{ he(Gerin) }} did not see it.
{{Elise}} fought sleep until Math rose to add {{ herd(Math) }} light to that of Elleb, whose nearly full disc rode high in the south. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} watched {{ her(Elise) }} face relax into slumber, murmured, “Sleep warm,” and kissed {{ herd(Elise) }} forehead. {{ She(Elise) }} smiled and stirred, but did not wake.
When {{Gerin}} told Van what {{ he(Gerin) }} had done, the out-lander slapped {{ hisd(Gerin) }} back, saying, “And what took you so long?”
The Fox grunted, half annoyed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend had been able to follow {{ hisd(Gerin) }} thoughts so well. Something else occurred to {{ him(Gerin) }}. “We need to start right at sunrise tomorrow,” {{ he(Gerin) }} said.
“What? Why?” Van did not seem to believe {{ hisd(Van) }} ears.
“I have my reasons.”
“They must be good ones, to make a slugabed like you want an early start. All right, captain, sunrise it is.”
They topped the last rise just as the sun climbed over the eastern horizon. It flamed off the Greater Inner Sea and transformed the water to a lambent sheet of fire, dazzling to the eye. Tiny black dots on that expanse were ships: merchantmen with broad sails billowing in the fresh morning breeze and arrogant galleys striding over the waves like outsized spiders on oared legs.
{{Elise}}, who had never seen the sea, cried out in wonder and delight. {{ She(Elise) }} squeezed {{Gerin}}'s hand. The Fox beamed, proud as if {{ he(Gerin) }}’d created the vista {{ himself(Gerin) }}. Van also nodded {{ hisd(Van) }} appreciation. “Very nice, captain, very nice,” {{ he(Van) }} told the {{ baron(Gerin) }}.
“If that’s all you can find to say, you’d likely say the same if Farris {{ herself(Elise) }} offered to share your bed.”
“{{ She(Elise) }}’s your {{ goddess(Elise) }} of love and such things?” At {{Gerin}}'s nod, Van went on, “I’ll tell you, Fox, that reminds me of a story—”
“Which I’ll hear some other time,” {{Gerin}} said firmly. Straight ahead, on a spur of land thrusting out into the sea, lay Elabon’s capital. All {{ hisd(Gerin) }} attention centered there.
A thousand years before, {{ he(Gerin) }} knew, it had been nothing but a farming village. Then the Sithonians came west across the Sea, and the infant city, now a center for Sithonian trade with the folk they deemed barbarous westerners, acquired its first wall. Its inhabitants learned much from the Sithonians. Little by little it extended its sway over the fertile western plain, drawing on ever greater reserves of men and resources. Soon it swallowed up the Sithonian colonies on the western shore of the Greater Inner Sea.
Nor could the Sithonians come to the aid of those colonies, for Sithonia itself, divided into rival confederacies led by its two greatest city-states, Siphnos and Kortys, fell into a century of bloody civil war. All the while, Elabon waxed. No sooner had Kortys at last beaten down its rival than it had to face the army of Carlun World-Bestrider, whose victory ended the Elabonian League and began the Empire of Elabon. A great marble statue of {{ him(Emperor) }}, ten times as high as a {{ man(Emperor) }}, still looked east from the shore. It was easy to spy, silhouetted against the bright sea.
Not far away from Carlun’s monument stood the Palace Imperial. Gleaming like an inverted icicle, it shot a spearpoint of marble and crystal to the sky. An eternal fire burned at its apex, a guide from afar to ships on the Inner Sea. Round it was a wide space of well-trimmed gardens, so the palace itself almost seemed a plant grown from some strange seed.
Near the palace was the nobles’ quarters; their homes were less imposing by far than the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}’s residence, but most were far more splendid than anything north of the Kirs.
To {{Gerin}}'s mind, though, the rest of Elabon was the Empire’s true heart. People of every race and tribe dwelt there; it boiled and bubbled cauldron-wise with the surge of life through its veins. There was a saying that you could buy anything in Elabon, including the one who sold it to you.
The Fox could have gazed on the city for hours, but from behind a gruff {{ bass(merchant) }} voice roared, “Move it there, you whorespawn! Do you want to diddle the whole day away?” The speaker was a merchant, a loudly unhappy one.
{{Gerin}} waved back at {{ him(merchant) }}. “This is the first time I’ve seen Elabon in eight years,” {{ he(Gerin) }} apologized.
The merchant was not appeased. “May it be your last, then, ever again. You stand gawking, you goat-loving booby, and here I am, trying to make an honest living from tight-fisted nobles and little bandit lordlings, and all my thirty wagons are piling into each other while you crane your fool neck. I ought to set my guards on you, and it’s a mark of my good temper and restraint that I don’t. Now move it!”
{{Gerin}} twitched the reins and got the horses moving. Van chuckled. “Fellow sounds like a sergeant I knew once.”
Like any town south of the mountains, Elabon had its ring of crucifixes. Because of the city’s size, the crosses made a veritable forest. Bright-winged gulls from off the Inner Sea squabbled with ravens and vultures over the dead meat on them. The stench was overpowering. {{Elise}} produced a wisp of scented cloth and pressed it to {{ herd(Elise) }} nose. {{Gerin}} wished for one of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own.
Expanding through long years of security, the capital had outgrown three walls. Two had vanished altogether, their bricks and stones going to swell the growth. Only a low ridge showed where the rammedearth core of the third had stood.
{{Gerin}} took the wagon down the city’s main street. The locals affectionately called it the Alley; it ran due east, arrow-straight, from the outskirts of the capital to the docks, and was filled with markets and shops from one end to the other. The Fox drove past the Lane of Silversmiths (a trade Kizzuwatnans dominated), the pottery mart where Sithonians and Elabonians cried their wares, odorous eateries serving the fare of every nation subject or neighbor to the Empire, the great canvas-roofed emporium where wheat imported from the northern shore of the Inner Sea was sold, a small nest of armorers and smiths (the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had to promise Van they would come back later), and so much else {{ he(Gerin) }} began to feel dizzy trying to take it all in at once.
Beggars limped, prostitutes of both sexes jiggled and pranced, scribes stood at the ready to write for illiterate patrons, minstrels played on every corner, and, no doubt, thieves lurked to despoil them of the coins they earned. Running, shouting children were everywhere underfoot. {{Gerin}} marveled that any of them lived to grow up. {{ He(Gerin) }} pricked up {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ears when {{ he(Gerin) }} heard one shouting, “Turgis!” {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} head swiveled till {{ he(Gerin) }} spied the {{ youth(Jouner) }}.
“Snatch that {{ lad(Jouner) }}, Van!” {{ He(Gerin) }} steered toward {{ hisd(Gerin) }} target, talking the horses to calm in chaos.
“Right you are, captain.” Van reached out and grabbed up a ragamuffin whose first {{ beard(Jouner) }} was just beginning to sprout.
“You can lead us to Turgis?” {{Gerin}} demanded.
“I can, {{ sirm(Gerin) }}, and swear by all the gods and goddesses no finer hostel than {{ his(Turgis) }} exists anywhere.”
“Spare me the glowing promises. I’m known to Turgis. Tell me, {{ lad(Jouner) }}, how is the old butterball?”
“{{ He(Turgis) }}’s well enough my {{ lord(Gerin) }}, indeed {{ he(Turgis) }} is, and generous of food, though sparing of praises. You turn left here, {{ sirm(Gerin) }},” {{ he(Jouner) }} added.
Within moments, {{Gerin}} was lost in the maze of the capital. {{ He(Gerin) }} did not think Turgis’ hostel had formerly been in this district; the old fraud must have moved. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} guide, who called {{ himself(Jouner) }} Jouner, gave directions mixed with shrill abuse directed at anyone who dared block the narrow, winding back streets. The abuse often came back with interest.
Jouner was also extravagantly admiring of {{ hisd(Jouner) }} charges—especially {{Elise}}. {{ She(Elise) }} blushed and tried to wave {{ him(Jouner) }} to silence, not recognizing that {{ hisd(Jouner) }} manner was part professional courtesy. Still, the Fox heard sincerity in the {{ lad(Jouner) }}’s voice, too.
Most of the houses in this part of the city were two-storied, flat-roofed structures. Their whitewashed outer walls defined the twisting paths of its streets. Despite occasional obscenities scrawled in charcoal, from the outside one was much like another. But within the austerity, {{Gerin}} knew, would be courtyards bright with flowers and cheerfully painted statuary. Some, perhaps, would be enlivened further by floor mosaics or intricately patterned carpets woven by the Urfa.
Poorer folk lived in apartment houses: “islands,” in Elabon’s slang. Solid and unlovely, the brick buildings towered fifty and sixty feet into the air, throwing whole blocks of houses into shadow. More than once, jars of slops emptied from some upper window splashed down into the street, sending passersby running for cover. “Watch it!” Van bellowed up. An instant later, two more loads just missed the wagon.
“That’s one of the first things you learn to watch for here,” {{Gerin}} told {{ him(Van) }}, remembering {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own experience. “They hold the high ground.”
When at last the travelers came to Turgis’ establishment, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} was agreeably surprised by the marble columns on either side of the entranceway and the close-cropped lawn in front of the hostel itself. “Go right in,” Jouner said, scrambling down. “I’ll see to your horses and wagon.”
“Many thanks, {{ lad(Jouner) }},” {{Gerin}} said as {{ he(Jouner) }} descended. {{ He(Gerin) }} gave the {{ boy(Jouner) }} a couple of coppers, then helped {{Elise}} down, taking the opportunity to hug {{ her(Elise) }} briefly.
“Have a care with that Shanda horse,” Van warned Jouner. “He snaps.”
The {{ boy(Jouner) }} nodded. As {{ he(Jouner) }} began to head for the stable, {{Elise}} said, “A moment. Jouner, how do you live in this stench?”
Puzzlement crossed Jouner’s face. “Stench, my {{ lady(Elise) }}? What stench? Travelers always complain about it, but I don’t notice a thing.”
Turgis met the travelers at the front door. {{ Hisd(Turgis) }} broad pate, brown as the leather apron {{ he(Turgis) }} wore, gleamed in the sunlight. A smile stretched across {{ hisd(Turgis) }} fat face, the ends of it disappearing into a thick graying {{ beard(Turgis) }}. “You appear to have come up in the world a mite,” {{Gerin}} said by way of greeting.
“Crave pardon, {{ sirm(Gerin) }}? No, wait, I know that voice, though you’ve had the wisdom to hide your face in hair.” Turgis’ grin widened. “A cocky young whelp by the name of {{Gerin}}, badly miscalled the Fox, not so?”
“Aye, it is, you old bandit. Also Van of the Strong Arm and the {{ lady(Elise) }} {{Elise}}.”
Turgis bobbed a bow. “You have a most lovely {{ wife(Elise) }}, Fox.”
“The {{ lady(Elise) }} is not my {{ wife(Elise) }},” {{Gerin}} said.
“Oh? My {{ lord(Van) }} Van—?”
“Nor mine.” Van grinned.
“Oh? Ho, ho!” Turgis laid a finger alongside {{ hisd(Turgis) }} nose and winked.
{{Elise}} spluttered indignation.
“Not that either,” {{Gerin}} said. “It’s a long story, and more complicated than I like.”
“I daresay it must be. Well, it would honor me if you tell it.”
“You’ll hear it before the day is done, never fear. Turgis, it does my heart good to see you again, and to know you’ve not forgotten me.”
“I, Turgis {{ son(Turgis) }} of Turpin, forget a friend? Never!”
{{Gerin}} had hoped for that opening. “Then no doubt you recall just as well the promise you made the night I left the city.”
The smile disappeared from Turgis’ face. “What promise was that, {{ lord(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}? We both looked into our cups too often that night, and it was a long time ago.”
“You won’t wriggle out as easy as that, you saucy robber. You know as well as I, you gave me an oath if ever I came this way again I’d have my rooms for the same rate as I had them then!”
“What? You insolent whelp, this is a whole new building—or had your oh-so-perfect memory not noticed that? Are you fain to hold me to a drunken vow? May your fundament fall out! And the way prices have risen! Why, I could weep great buckets and your flinty heart would not be so much as—”
“An oath, damn your eyes, an oath!” {{Gerin}} said. Both were laughing now.
Turgis talked right through {{ him(Gerin) }}.”—softened. Think of my {{ wife-opp(Turgis) }}! Think of my children! My youngest {{ son(wizard1) }} Egginhard would study wizardry, and for such school, nothing less than which is {{ hisd(wizard1) }} heart’s desire, much silver is needed.”
“If {{ he(wizard1) }} would be a conjurer, let {{ him(wizard1) }} magic it up, and not have {{ hisd(wizard1) }} {{ father(Turgis) }} steal it.”
“Think of my poor maiden aunt!” Turgis wailed.
“When I was here last, your poor maiden aunt ran the biggest gambling den in the city, you blood-sucker. An oath, remember?”
“As my head lives, only a third more would satisfy me—”
“On that your head would live entirely too well. Would you be known as Turgis the Oathbreaker?”
“May all the grapes in every vineyard you own turn sour!”
“Don’t own any at all, truth to tell: too far north. Is your memory jogged yet?”
Turgis hopped on one foot, hopped on the other foot, plucked a gray hair from {{ hisd(Turgis) }} {{ beard(Turgis) }}, and sighed heavily. “All right, I recollect. Bah! The innkeeping trade lost a great one when you became a pirate or {{ baron(Gerin) }} or whatever it is you do. I’m sure you’re a howling success. Now go howl and let me lick my wounds—or do you carry courtesy so far?”
“What do you think, Van?” {{Gerin}} said.
{{ Hisd(Gerin) }} comrade had watched the altercation with amusement. “Reckon so, captain, if your friend can fix me up with a hot tub big enough for my bulk.”
“Who dares call Turgis {{ son(Turgis) }} of Turpin a friend of this backwoods bandit? Were I half my age and twice my size, I’d challenge you for that. As is, however, go down this corridor. Third door on the left. You might follow {{ him(Van) }}, {{Gerin}}; even your name stinks in my nostrils at this moment. And for you, my {{ lady(Elise) }}, we have somewhat more elegant arrangements. If you would care to follow me …?”
Turgis led {{Elise}} off to whatever facilities {{ he(Turgis) }} had for making beautiful {{ women(Elise) }} more so. {{ She(Elise) }} seemed as much captivated by the innkeeper as was {{Gerin}} {{ himself(Gerin) }}; though this was a new building, the same atmosphere of comfort and good cheer the Fox had always known was here. Other hostels might have had more splendid accommodations, but none of them had Turgis.
The bath-houses masseur was a slim young Sithonian with outsized hands, arms, and shoulders. {{ Hisd(Vatatzes) }} name was Vatatzes. As if by magic, {{ he(Vatatzes) }} had two steaming tubs ready and waiting. {{ He(Vatatzes) }} helped Van unlace {{ hisd(Van) }} corselet. When the outlander shed {{ hisd(Van) }} bronze-studded leather kilt, Vatatzes, true to the predilections of {{ hisd(Vatatzes) }} nation, whistled in awe and admiration.
“Sorry, my friend,” Van chuckled, understanding {{ him(Vatatzes) }} well enough. “{{Gerin}} and I both like {{ girls(lover1) }}.”
“You poor dears,” Vatazes said. {{ Hisd(Vatatzes) }} disappointment did not stop {{ him(Vatatzes) }} from kneading away the kinks of travel as the hot water soaked off grime. Swathed in linen towels and mightily relaxed, {{Gerin}} and Van emerged from the bath to find Jouner waiting outside. “I’ve taken the liberty of moving your gear to your rooms,” {{ he(Jouner) }} said. “Follow me if you would, {{ sirm(Gerin) }}.” {{ He(Jouner) }} also offered to carry Van’s cuirass but, as usual, the outlander declined to be parted from it even for a moment.
The rooms were on the second floor of the hostel. They offered a fine view of the Palace Imperial. A door which could be barred on either side gave access from one to the other. “Don’t bother to put things away,” {{Gerin}} told Jouner. “I’d sooner do it myself—that way I know where everything is.”
“As you wish, my {{ lord(Gerin) }}.” Jouner pocketed a tip and disappeared.
{{Gerin}} surveyed the room. If nothing else, it was more spacious than the cubicle {{ he(Gerin) }} had called {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own during {{ hisd(Gerin) }} former stay in the capital. Nor would {{ he(Gerin) }} sleep on a straw pallet as {{ he(Gerin) }} had then. {{ He(Gerin) }} had a mattress and pillow, both stuffed with goosedown, and two thick wool blankets to ward off night’s chill. By the bed were a jug, bowl, and chamberpot, all of Sithonian ware fine enough to be worth a small fortune north of the Kirs. A footstool, chair, and stout oaken chest completed the furnishings. On the chest were two fat beeswax candles and a shrine to {{Dyaus}} with a pinch of perfumed incense already smoking away. Above it hung an encaustic painting of a mountain scene done by a Sithonian homesick for {{ his(Gerin) }} craggy native land.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} quickly unpacked and threw {{ himself(Gerin) }} onto the bed, sighing with pleasure as {{ he(Gerin) }} sank into its soft stuffing. Van rapped on the connecting door. “This is the life!” {{ he(Van) }} said when {{Gerin}} let {{ him(Van) }} in. “I haven’t seen beds so fine since a bordello I visited in Jalor. I don’t know about you, Fox, but I’m all for sacking out for a while. It’s been a long, hard trip.”
“I was thinking the same thing,” {{Gerin}} told {{ him(Van) }}. Yawning, Van went back into {{ hisd(Van) }} own room. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} knew {{ he(Gerin) }} should go down to see how {{Elise}} liked {{ herd(Elise) }} chamber.. Enervated from the hot bath and massage and tired from many nights with little sleep, {{ he(Gerin) }} could not find the energy.…
The next thing {{ he(Gerin) }} knew, Jouner was knocking on the door. “My {{ lord(Gerin) }},” {{ he(Jouner) }} called, “Turgis bids you join {{ him(Turgis) }} in the taproom for supper in half an hour’s time.”
“Thanks, {{ lad(Jouner) }}. I’ll be there.” {{Gerin}} yawned and stretched. {{ He(Gerin) }} heard Jouner deliver the same message to Van, who eventually grumbled a reply.
It was a bit past sunset. Tiwaz’s razor-thin crescent, almost invisible in the pink in the west.
The Fox splashed water on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} face, then went rummaging through {{ hisd(Gerin) }} gear for an outfit that might impress Turgis and, not incidentally, {{Elise}}. After some thought, {{ he(Gerin) }} decided on a maroon tunic with sleeves flaring out from the elbows and checked {{ trousers(Gerin) }} of contrasting shades of blue. A necklace of gold nuggets and a belt with a bronze buckle in the shape of a leaping longtooth (Shanda work, that) completed the outfit. Wishing for a mirror, {{ he(Gerin) }} combed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hair and {{ beard(Gerin) }} with a bone comb. I look the very northerner, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought: well, fair enough, that’s what I am. {{ He(Gerin) }} set out for the taproom.
Folk of every race filled the high-ceilinged hall. Three musicians—flautist, piper, and mandolin-player—performed on a small stage at one end, but they were all but ignored. Everyone’s attention was on Turgis’ cook.
A dark, burly {{ fellow(cook) }} with hooked noise, bushy {{ beard(cook) }}, and black hair drawn back into a bun, {{ he(cook) }} worked behind a great bronze griddle in the center of the room, and in {{ hisd(cook) }} own way was more a showman than the musicians. {{ He(cook) }} kept up a steady stream of chatter about every dish {{ he(cook) }} was preparing, and knives were quicker in {{ hisd(cook) }} hands than in those of any warrior {{Gerin}} had ever seen. Its gleam reflecting off {{ his(cook) }} sweaty face, bronze danced as if alive, shining in the torchlight, dicing vegetables and slicing meat with a rhythm of its own. No, not quite; with a small shock, {{Gerin}} realized the knives were providing a percussion accompaniment to the music from the stage.
A waiter hovering by {{ hisd(Gerin) }} elbow, Turgis sat at a quiet corner table. {{ He(Turgis) }} surged to {{ hisd(Turgis) }} feet and embraced {{Gerin}}, who pointed to the cook and asked, “Where did you find {{ him(cook) }}?”
“{{ He(cook) }}’s something, isn’t {{ he(cook) }}?” Turgis beamed. “{{ He(cook) }}’s good for business, too. Just watching {{ him(cook) }} makes people hungry.” {{ He(Turgis) }} turned to the server, saying, “Bring me my special bottle. You know the one I mean. Bring some ordinary good wine, too, and—hmm—four glasses.”
The Fox’s eyes widened. “That can’t be the same ‘special bottle’ you used to keep when I was here before?”
“The very same, and not much lower, either. Where would I get another? You know as well as I that it was salvage from a ship of some unknown land that wrecked itself down in the southeast on the Bay of Parvela’s rocks. Aye, it’s precious stuff, my friend—see, I still call you that, highway robber though you be—but then how often do we look upon friends thought lost forever?”
“Not often enough.”
“Truth in your words, truth in your words.”
The waiter returned. Careful not to spill even one drop, Turgis worked at the cork of the flask they had been discussing. Even that flask was special: small and squat and silvery, like no other glass {{Gerin}} had seen. “Here it is,” Turgis said. “Nectar of the sun.”
{{Gerin}} had a sudden terrible fear that when Van came down, {{ he(Van) }} would loudly announce {{ he(Van) }} had traveled with whole shiploads of the brew. By rights, there should be no more than this one miraculous bottle.
At Turgis’ murmured invitation, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} enjoyed the rare drink’s rich fragrance. A silence fell over the hall. For a moment, {{Gerin}} thought {{ hisd(Gerin) }} nose’s pleasure had made {{ him(Gerin) }} ignore {{ hisd(Gerin) }} other senses, but the quiet was real. {{ He(Gerin) }} looked up. There in the doorway stood Van, helm and armor gleaming, crimson cloak over {{ hisd(Van) }} shoulders matching helm’s crest. {{ He(Van) }} was a splendid sight: indeed, too splendid, for {{Gerin}} heard a mutter of superstitious marvel. “Come in and sit down, you great gowk,” {{ he(Gerin) }} called, “before everyone decides you’re a {{ god(Van) }}.”
Van’s earthy reply sent relieved laughter echoing through the room. The outlander joined {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ hostm(Turgis)}}. {{ He(Gerin) }} looked with interest at the bottle {{Gerin}} still held. “Never seen glasswork like that before,” {{ he(Gerin) }} said, and the Fox, too, knew relief.
A few moments later, {{Elise}} arrived. The buzz of conversation in the taproom again lowered, this time in appreciation. As {{Gerin}} rose to greet {{ her(Elise) }}, {{ he(Gerin) }} realized once more how fair {{ she(Elise) }} was. {{ He(Gerin) }} had grown used to {{ her(Elise) }} in battered traveler’s hat and sturdy but unlovely clothes. Now, in a clinging {{ gown(Elise) }} of sea-green linen, {{ she(Elise) }} was another creature altogether, and startlingly beautiful.
Turgis’ servitors had subtly enhanced the colors of {{ herd(Elise) }} eyes and lips, and worked {{ herd(Elise) }} hair into a pile of fluffy curls. The style became {{ her(Elise) }}; it was popular in Elabon this year, and several other {{ women(Elise) }} in the hall wore their hair thus. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} saw more than one jealous glance directed at {{Elise}}, and felt proud to have earned the affection of such a {{ woman(Elise) }}.
Turgis was also on {{ hisd(Turgis) }} feet. {{ He(Turgis) }} bowed and kissed {{Elise}}’s hand. “The sunshine of my {{ lady(Elise) }}’s beauty brightens my hostel,” {{ he(Turgis) }} exclaimed. When {{ he(Turgis) }} saw {{ he(Turgis) }} had flustered {{ her(Elise) }}, {{ he(Turgis) }} added with a wink, “What in {{Dyaus}}’ name do you see in this predacious lout who brought you here?” Put at {{ her(Elise) }} ease, {{ she(Elise) }} smiled and sat. Turgis poured a drop or two of {{ hisd(Turgis) }} nectar of the sun into each of the four glasses, then resealed the flask. {{ He(Turgis) }} raised {{ hisd(Turgis) }} glass. “To past friendships now restored and successes yet to come!”
Everyone drank. {{Gerin}} felt the brew caress {{ hisd(Gerin) }} tongue like smooth silk, like soft kisses. {{ He(Gerin) }} heard Van’s hum of approval and was glad {{ hisd(Gerin) }} far-traveled friend had found a new thing to enjoy.
Turgis poured again, this time from the local bottle. As {{Gerin}}'s stomach began to growl, the waiter returned, bringing dinner just in time, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought, to save {{ him(Gerin) }} from starvation. The first course was a delicate clear soup, made flavorful by bits of pork and chopped scallion. It was followed by what Turgis called a “meat tile,” which convinced the Fox that Turgis’ cook was a genius as well as a showman: simmered and sautéed pieces of lamb and veal in a spicy sauce which also featured pounded lobster tail and nutmeats. Whole lobster tails garnished the incredible creation; {{Gerin}} had never tasted anything so delicious in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} life. {{ He(Gerin) }} could hardly look at the fruits and spun-sugar confections that came after. All the while, Turgis made sure no glass stayed empty long.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s head was beginning to spin when Turgis announced, “Now I will have the tale of your coming here.”
All three travelers told it, each amplifying the others’ accounts. {{Gerin}} tried to slide through the tale of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fight with the aurochs, but to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} annoyance {{Elise}} made {{ him(Gerin) }} backtrack and tell it in full.
Turgis looked at {{ him(Gerin) }} shrewdly. “Still carrying your lantern with a hood on it, are you?” {{ He(Gerin) }} turned to {{Elise}}: “My {{ lady(Elise) }}, here we have the most talented of {{ men(Gerin) }}, the only one who does not know it being {{ himself(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} can sing a song, cut a purse (even mine, the unprincipled highwayman!), tell you what that finger-long bug is on friend Van’s cuirass—and the cure for its bite as well—”
“You see?” Turgis said triumphantly. The wine had flushed {{ hisd(Turgis) }} face and loosened {{ hisd(Turgis) }} tongue. “{{ He(Gerin) }} can conjure you up an ever-filled purse—”
“Of mud, perhaps,” {{Gerin}} said, wishing Turgis would shut up. The innkeeper’s paean of praise made {{ him(Gerin) }} nervous. Most plaudits did; as a second {{ son(Gerin) }}, {{ he(Gerin) }}’d seldom got them and never quite worked out how to deal with them. {{ He(Gerin) }} knew {{ hisd(Gerin) }} virtues well enough, and knew one of the greatest was {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ability to keep {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mouth shut about them. They were often of most use when employed unexpectedly.
Turgis was not about to be quiet. “Besides all that,” {{ he(Turgis) }} said, “this northern ruffian is as kind and loyal a friend as one could ever hope for”—{{Elise}} and Van nodded solemnly—“and worth any three {{ men(Gerin) }} you could name in a brawl. I well recall the day {{ he(Gerin) }} flattened three rascals who thought to rob me, though {{ he(Gerin) }} wasn’t much more than a stripling {{ himself(Gerin) }}.”
“You never told me that one,” Van said.
“They were just tavern toughs,” {{Gerin}} said, “and this {{ fellow(Turgis) }} here did a lot of the work. {{ He(Turgis) }}’s pretty handy with a broken bottle.”
“Me?” Turgis said. “No one wants to hear about me, fat old slug that I am. What happened after the aurochs was slain?” The hosteler howled laughter to hear how {{Mavrix}} had been thwarted. “Truly, I love the {{ god(Mavrix) }} for {{ hisd(Mavrix) }} gift of the grape, but much of {{ hisd(Mavrix) }} cult gives me chills.”
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} quickly brought the journey down to the capital: too quickly, again, for {{Elise}}. {{ She(Elise) }} said, “Once more {{ he(Gerin) }} leaves out a vital bit of the story. You see, as we traveled we came to care for each other more and more, try though {{ he(Gerin) }} would to hide {{ himself(Gerin) }} behind modesty and gloom.” {{ She(Elise) }} gave {{ him(Gerin) }} a challenging stare. {{ He(Gerin) }} would not meet {{ herd(Elise) }} eye, riveting {{ hisd(Gerin) }} attention on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} glass. {{ She(Elise) }} went on, “And so it’s scarcely surprising that when {{ he(Gerin) }} asked if {{ he(Gerin) }} might come south to court me when the trouble is done, I was proud to say yes.”
“{{ Lord(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}, my heartiest congratulations,” Turgis said, pumping {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hand. “My {{ lady(Elise) }}, I would offer you the same, but I grieve to think of your beauty passed on to your children diluted by the blood of this ape.”
{{Gerin}} jerked {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hand free of the innkeeper’s grip. “A fine excuse for a host you are, to insult your guests.”
“Insult? I thought I was giving you the benefit of the doubt.” Turgis poured wine all around. A sudden commotion drowned out {{ hisd(Turgis) }} toast. Two laborers who had been arguing over the company of a coldly beautiful Sithonian courtesan rose from their seats and began pummeling each other. Three husky waiters seized them and wrestled them out to the street.
Turgis mopped {{ hisd(Turgis) }} brow. “A good thing they chose to quarrel now. The could have broken {{Osnabroc}}’s concentration—see, here {{ he(Osnabroc) }} comes!”
A rising hum of excitement and a few spatters of applause greeted {{Osnabroc}}, a short, stocky {{ man(Osnabroc) }} whose every muscle was so perfectly defined that it might have been sculpted from stone. {{ He(Osnabroc) }} wore only a loincloth. In {{ hisd(Osnabroc) }} hand {{ he(Osnabroc) }} carried a pole about twenty feet long; a crosspiece had been nailed a yard or so from one end.
A pair of young {{ women(dancers) }} followed {{ him(Osnabroc) }}. They, too, wore only loincloths, one of red silk, the other of green. Both had the lithe, taut-bellied look of dancers or acrobats; {{Gerin}} doubted if either was five feet tall.
The musicians vacated the stage and {{Osnabroc}} ascended. More torches were brought. Each {{ girl(dancers) }} took one and set the rest in brackets. After a sharp, short bow to {{ hisd(Osnabroc) }} audience, {{Osnabroc}} arched {{ hisd(Osnabroc) }} back and bent {{ hisd(Osnabroc) }} head backwards, setting the pole on {{ hisd(Osnabroc) }} forehead. {{ He(Osnabroc) }} balanced it with effortless ease. At {{ hisd(Osnabroc) }} command, both {{ girls(dancers) }} shinnied up the pole, torches in their teeth. Once at the crosspiece, they turned somersaults, flips, and other evolutions so astounding {{Gerin}} felt {{ hisd(Gerin) }} heart rise into {{ hisd(Gerin) }} throat. All the while, the pole stayed steady as a rock.
One {{ girl(dancers) }} slid down headfirst, leaving the other hanging by {{ herd(dancers) }} knees twenty feet above the floor. But not for long—{{ she( dancers) }} flailed {{ herd(dancers) }} arms once, twice, and then {{ she(dancers) }} was upright again, going through a series of yet more spectacular capers. Despite {{ herd(dancers) }} gyrations, the supporting pole never budged. A grimace of concentration distorted {{Osnabroc}}’s face; sweat ran streakily down {{ hisd(Osnabroc) }} magnificent body.
“Who do you think has the harder job?” Turgis whispered to {{Gerin}}: “{{Osnabroc}} or {{ hisd(Osnabroc) }} {{ girls(dancers) }}?”
“I couldn’t begin to tell you,” the {{ baron(Gerin) }} answered.
Turgis laughed and nodded. “It’s the same with me. I couldn’t begin to tell you, either.”
Van, though, had no doubts: {{ hisd(Van) }} eyes were only on the whirling {{ girl(dancers) }}. “Just think,” {{ he(Van) }} said, half to {{ himself(Van) }}, “of all the ways you could do it with a {{ lass(dancers) }} so limber! {{ She(dancers) }} all but flies.”
“Speak to me not of people flying!” Turgis said as the second {{ girl(dancers) }} slid down the pole to a thunderous ovation. {{ She(dancers) }} skipped off the stage, followed by {{ herd(dancers) }} fellow acrobat and {{Osnabroc}}. {{ He(Osnabroc) }} sagged now as {{ he(Osnabroc) }} walked, and {{ hisd(Osnabroc) }} forehead looked puffy.
Van tried to catch the eye of one of the {{ girls(dancers) }}, but with no apparent luck. Disappointed, {{ he(Van) }} turned {{ hisd(Van) }} attention back to Turgis. “What do you have against people flying?” {{ he(Van) }} asked.
“Nothing against it, precisely. It does remind me of a strange story, though.” {{ He(Turgis) }} waited to be urged to go on. {{ Hisd(Turgis) }} companions quickly obliged {{ him(Turgis) }}. {{ He(Turgis) }} began, “You’ve told me much of the Trokmoi tonight; this story has a Trokmê in it too. {{ He(warrior2) }} was drunk, as they often are, and since the place was crowded that night, {{ he(warrior2) }} was sharing a table with a {{ wizard(wizard2) }}. You know how some folk, when they go too deep into a bottle, like to sing or whatever. Well, this {{ lad(warrior2) }} flapped {{ hisd(warrior2) }} arms like {{ he(warrior2) }} was trying to take off and fly. Finally {{ he(warrior2) }} knocked a drink from the {{ wizard(wizard2) }}’s hand, which was the wrong thing to do.
“The {{ wizard(wizard2) }} paid {{ hisd(warrior2) }} scot and walked out, and I thought I’d been lucky enough to escape trouble. But next thing I knew, the northerner started flapping again, and—may my private parts shrivel if I lie—sure enough {{ he(warrior2) }} took off and flew around the room like a drunken buzzard.”
“A boozard, maybe,” {{Gerin}} suggested.
“I hope not,” Turgis said.
“What befell?” {{Elise}} asked.
“{{ He(warrior2) }} did, {{ lass(Elise) }}, on {{ hisd(warrior2) }} head. {{ He(warrior2) }} was doing a fine job of flying, just like a bird, but the poor sot smashed against that candelabra you see up there and fell right into someone’s soup. {{ He(warrior2) }} earned {{ himself(warrior2) }} a knot on the head as big as an egg and, I hope, enough sense not to make another {{ wizard(wizard2) }} annoyed at {{ him(warrior2) }}.
“This tale-telling gets to be thirsty work,” Turgis added, calling for another bottle of wine. But when {{ he(Turgis) }} opened it and began to pour, {{Elise}} put a hand over {{ herd(Elise) }} glass. A few minutes later {{ she(Elise) }} rose. Pausing only to bestow a hurried but warm kiss on {{Gerin}}, {{ she(Elise) }} made {{ herd(Elise) }} way to {{ herd(Elise) }} room.
The three friends sat, drank, and talked a bit longer. Turgis said, “{{Gerin}}, you’re no fool like that Trokmê was. You’re the last {{ man(Gerin) }} I ever would have picked to make a {{ sorcerer(Balamung) }} your mortal foe.”
“It was {{ hisd(Balamung) }} choosing, not mine!” The wine had risen to {{Gerin}}'s head, adding vehemence to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} words. “The gods decreed I am not to be a scholar, as I had dreamed. So be it. Most of my bitterness is gone. There’s satisfaction in holding the border against the barbarians, and more in making my holding a better place for all to live, vassals and serfs alike. Much of what I learned here has uses in the north: we no longer have wells near the cesspits, for instance, and we grow beans to refresh the soil. And, though my vassals know it not, I’ve taught a few of the brighter peasants to read.”
“What? You have?” Van stared at the Fox as if {{ he(Van) }}’d never seen {{ him(Gerin) }} before.
“Aye, and I’m not sorry, either.” {{Gerin}} turned back to Turgis. “We’ve had no famines round Fox Keep, despite two bad winters, and no peasant revolts either. {{ Wizard(Balamung) }} or no {{ wizard(Balamung) }}, no skulking savage is going to ruin all I’ve worked so hard to kill. {{ He(Balamung) }} may kill me—the way things look now, {{ he(Balamung) }} likely will kill me—but {{Dyaus}} knows {{ he(Balamung) }}’ll never run me off!”
{{ He(Gerin) }} slammed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} glass to the table with such violence that it shattered and cut {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hand. The pain abruptly sobered {{ him(Gerin) }}. Startled by {{ hisd(Gerin) }} outburst, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friends exclaimed in sympathy. {{ He(Gerin) }} sat silent and somber, staring at the thin stream of blood that welled from between {{ hisd(Gerin) }} clenched fingers.
<h2>VIII</h2>
After the Alley’s hurley-burley, the calm, nearly trafficless lanes of the nobles’ quarter came as a relief. Jouner had given the Fox careful directions on how to find {{Elise}}’s {{ uncle(Valdabrun) }}’s home. For a miracle, they proved good as well as careful.
{{Valdabrun}} the Stout lived almost in the shadow of the Palace Imperial. Despite {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} closeness to the Empire’s heart, the grounds of {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} home were less imposing than those of many nobles in less prestigious areas. No carefully trimmed topiaries adorned {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} lawns, no statuary group stood frozen in mid-cavort. Nor did the drive from the road wind and twist its way to {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} house under sweetly scented trees. It ran directly to {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} front door, straight as the Elabon Way. The dominant impression {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} grounds gave was one of discipline and strength.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} hitched the horses. Van gave both beasts feedbags, eluding a snap from the Shanda pony. {{ He(Van) }} cuffed it, grumbling, “Poxy animal would sooner have my hand than its oats.”
{{Valdabrun}}’s door-knocker was a snarling bronze longtooth’s head. {{Gerin}} grasped a fang, swung it up, then down. {{ He(Gerin) }} had expected the knock to set off sorcerous chimes. Many southern nobles liked such conceits. But there was only the honest clang of metal on metal. After a stir inside, a retainer swung open the door. “Gentles, how may I help you?” {{ he(retainer1) }} asked crisply.
The {{ man(retainer1) }}’s speech and bearing impressed {{Gerin}}: {{ he(retainer1) }} seemed more soldier than servitor. “Is your {{ master(Valdabrun) }} in?” the Fox asked.
“{{ Lord(Valdabrun) }} {{Valdabrun}}? No, but I expect {{ him(Valdabrun) }} back shortly. Would you care to wait?”
“If you would be so kind.”
“This way, then.” Executing a smart about-turn, the servant led them to a rather bare antechamber. {{ He(retainer1) }} briefly saw to their comfort, then said, “If you will excuse me, I have other duties to perform.” {{ He(retainer1) }} left through another door; {{Gerin}} heard {{ him(retainer1) }} bar it after {{ himself(retainer1) }}.
A {{ woman(Namarra) }}’s voice, low and throaty, came from behind the door. {{Gerin}} could not make out {{ herd(Namarra) }} words, but heard the steward reply, “I know not, {{ lady(Namarra) }} {{Namarra}}. They did not state their business, nor did I inquire deeply.”
“I will see them,” the {{ woman(Namarra) }} said.
The bar was lifted. {{Valdabrun}}'s retainer announced, “Gentles, my {{ lord(Valdabrun) }} {{Valdabrun}}'s, ah, companion, the {{ lady(Namarra) }} {{Namarra}},” and went off.
As {{Namarra}} entered, Van sprang to {{ hisd(Van) }} feet. {{Gerin}} was only a blink behind. No matter what {{ he(Gerin) }} felt toward {{Elise}}, {{Valdabrun}}'s companion was, quite simply, the most spectacular {{ woman(Namarra) }} {{ he(Gerin) }} had every seen: tiny, catlike, and exquisite. The clinging silk {{ she(Namarra) }} wore accented {{ herd(Namarra) }} figure’s lushness.
{{ Herd(Namarra) }} hair, worn short and straight, was the color of flame. Like a fire, it seemed to give out more light than fell on it. Yet for all that incandescent hair, {{ she(Namarra) }} was no Trokmê {{ woman(Namarra) }}; {{ herd(Namarra) }} face was soft, rounded, and small-featured, {{ herd(Namarra) }} skin golden brown. {{ Herd(Namarra) }} eyes, a slightly darker shade of gold, were subtly slanted but rounded as if in perpetual surprise; the strange combination, more than anything save perhaps {{ herd(Namarra) }} purring name, made {{Gerin}} think {{ her(Namarra) }} feline. {{ She(Namarra) }} wore no jewelry—she {{ herself(Namarra) }} was ornament enough, and more.
{{ She(Namarra) }} studied the Fox with some interest, Van with a good deal more, and {{Elise}} with the wary concern one gave any dangerous beast suddenly found in the parlor. Out of the corner of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eye, {{Gerin}} saw {{Elise}} returning that look. {{ He(Gerin) }} felt a twinge of alarm.
{{Namarra}} swept out a lithe arm to point at the {{ baron(Gerin) }}. “You are—?”
{{ He(Gerin) }} introduced {{ himself(Gerin) }} and Van, and was on the point of naming {{Elise}} when {{ he(Gerin) }} was interrupted: “And your charming, ah, companion?” {{Namarra}} used the same deliberately ambiguous intonation the steward had applied to {{ her(Elise) }}.
Voice dangerously calm, {{Elise}} replied, “I am {{Elise}}, {{Ricolf}}’s {{ daughter(Elise) }}.” The Fox noticed {{ she(Elise) }} made no claim of relationship to {{Valdabrun}}.
The name of {{Elise}}’s {{ father(Ricolf) }} meant nothing to {{Namarra}}. {{ She(Namarra) }} turned back to {{Gerin}}. “May I ask your business with my {{ lord(Valdabrun) }}?”
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} was not sure how to reply. {{ He(Gerin) }} had no idea how much of the noble’s confidence and trust {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} {{ woman(Valdabrun) }} enjoyed. {{ He(Gerin) }} was framing an equivocal answer when a door slammed at the back of the house. Seconds later, the retainer reappeared, to announce {{ hisd(retainer1) }} {{ master(Valdabrun) }}’s presence.
“Enough of this foolishness. Let me by,” {{Valdabrun}} the Stout said as {{ he(Valdabrun) }} surged into the antechamber.
{{Gerin}} hastily revised {{ hisd(Gerin) }} notion of what the noble’s sobriquet implied. {{Valdabrun}} was edging toward fifty, greying, and did in fact carry a considerable paunch, but the Fox was sure {{ he(Gerin) }} would break fingers if {{ he(Gerin) }} rammed a fist into it. Clean face or no, here was a soldier, and no mistake. Hard eyes, firm mouth, the set of {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} chin all bespoke a {{ man(Valdabrun) }} long used to command. Nor was {{ he(Valdabrun) }} slow to see {{ he(Valdabrun) }} faced two of {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} own breed.
The air in the room crackled as the three strong warriors took one another’s measure. Each in their own way was a warrior to reckon with: {{Gerin}} supple, clever, always waiting for a foe to expose a flaw; Van, who fought with a berserker’s delight and a drillmaster’s elegance; and their host, who reminded the Fox of one of Carlun’s or Ros’ great captains: a {{ man(Valdabrun) }} with scant polish or flair, but possessed of an almost brutal indomitability, the very concept of retreat alien to {{ him(Valdabrun) }}.
The tableau held for long seconds. {{Elise}} shattered it, exclaiming “{{ Uncle(Valdabrun) }}!” and throwing {{ herself(Elise) }} into {{Valdabrun}}'s startled arms. The stern expression dropped from {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} face, to be replaced by one of utter bafflement.
{{Namarra}}’s face changed, too. {{ Herd(Namarra) }} eyes narrowed; {{ herd(Namarra) }} lips drew back, exposing white, pointed teeth. A cat {{ she(Namarra) }} was, and feral. {{ She(Namarra) }} laid a hand on {{Valdabrun}}’s arm. “My {{ lord(Valdabrun) }}—” {{ she(Namarra) }} began.
“Be still, my dear,” {{ he(Valdabrun) }} said, and {{ she(Namarra) }} was still, though restive. {{Gerin}}'s respect for {{ him(Valdabrun) }} grew. {{ He(Valdabrun) }} untangled {{ himself(Valdabrun) }} from {{Elise}}. “Young {{ lady(Elise) }}, you will explain yourself,” {{ he(Valdabrun) }} told {{ her(Elise) }}, still in that tone of command.
{{ She(Elise) }} was as matter-of-fact as {{ he(Valdabrun) }}. “Of course. As I told your leman”—{{Namarra}} bristled, but held {{ herd(Namarra) }} tongue— {{Elise}}, {{ daughter(Elise) }} of {{Ricolf}} the Red and your {{ sister-opp(Ricolf) }} Yrse. My {{ mother-opp(Ricolf) }} always said you would know this locket.” {{ She(Elise) }} drew it up from between {{ herd(Elise) }} tunic, freed it of its chain, and handed it to {{Valdabrun}}.
{{ He(Valdabrun) }} examined it at arm’s length; {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} sight had begun to lengthen, as it often does in the middle years. {{ Hisd(Valdabrun) }} face softened, as much as that craggy countenance could. “Yrse’s child!” {{ he(Valdabrun) }} said softly. This time, {{ he(Valdabrun) }} folded {{ her(Elise) }} into a bearlike embrace.
Behind {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} back, {{Namarra}}’s expression was frightening.
{{Elise}} introduced {{Gerin}} and Van to {{Valdabrun}}. “I’ve heard of you, sirrah,” {{ he(Valdabrun) }} told the Fox: “One of those who never pay their taxes, aye?”
“I pay them in blood,” {{Gerin}} answered soberly.
{{Valdabrun}} surprised {{ him(Gerin) }} by nodding. “So you do, youngling, so you do.” {{ He(Valdabrun) }} exchanged a bone-wrenching handclasp with Van that left both big warriors wincing, then announced, “Now I will have the tale of your coming here.” {{ He(Valdabrun) }} visibly composed {{ himself(Valdabrun) }} to listen.
As they had the night before to Turgis, the three of them told their story. “I never thought that harebrained scheme would work,” {{Valdabrun}} observed when {{Elise}} spoke of {{ herd(Elise) }} {{ father(Ricolf) }}’s plan to find {{ her(Elise) }} a spouse.
The noble proved a far more skeptical audience than Turgis had, firing probing questions at {{Gerin}} on {{Balamung}}’s wizardry, politics in the northlands, {{Mavrix}}’s cultists, and whatever else caught {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} interest.
“Well, well,” {{ he(Valdabrun) }} said at last. “The whole thing is so unlikely I suppose it must be true. Child, you are welcome to stay with me as long as you like.” {{ He(Valdabrun) }} told {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} retainer to take {{ herd(Elise) }} gear from the wagon, then turned to {{Namarra}}, who appeared less than delighted at {{ his(Valdabrun) }} {{ niece(Elise) }}’s arrival. “Kitten, show {{Elise}} around while I talk with these rogues.”
“Of course. We can talk as we go. Come, child.” In {{Namarra}}’s red-lipped mouth, the word was poisonously sweet.
“That would be wonderful,” {{Elise}} answered. “I’ve always wanted to talk to a {{ woman(Namarra) }} of your, ah, experience.” A tiny smile on {{ herd(Elise) }} face, {{ she(Elise) }} kissed Van and {{Gerin}}, fiercely hugged the Fox, and whispered, “This will be hard. Hurry back, please!” {{ She(Elise) }} followed {{Namarra}} out. When the door closed behind {{ her(Elise) }}, {{Gerin}} felt the sunshine had left the day.
{{Valdabrun}} seemed oblivious to the byplay between the {{Elise}} and {{Namarra}}. That proved again to the {{ baron(Gerin) }} that {{ he(Valdabrun) }} was more used to the field than to the imperial court’s intrigues. After {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} {{ niece(Elise) }} and companion were gone, {{ he(Valdabrun) }} said bluntly, “Fox, if half what you’ve said is true, your arse is in a sling.”
“I’d be lying if I said I liked the odds,” {{Gerin}} agreed.
“Advice from me would be nothing but damned impertinence right now, so I’ll give you none. But I will say this: if anyone is slippery enough to slide through this net, you may be the one. Yet you seem to have kept your honor too. I’m glad of it, for my {{ niece(Elise) }}’s—how strange that seems!—sake.” {{ He(Valdabrun) }} shifted {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} attention to Van. “Could I by any chance persuade you to join the Imperial Guard?” {{ His(Valdabrun) }} smile showed {{ he(Valdabrun) }} knew the question foolish before {{ he(Valdabrun) }} asked it.
Van shook {{ hisd(Van) }} head; the plume of {{ hisd(Van) }} helm swayed gently. “You’re not like most of the popinjays here, {{Valdabrun}}. You seem a fighter. So you tell me: where will I find better fighting than with the Fox?”
“There you have me,” {{Valdabrun}} said. “Gentles, I would like nothing more than talking the day away over a few stoups of wine, but I must get back to the palace. The Eshref clan out of Shanda have forced a pass in the Skleros Mountains, and their brigands are plundering northern Sithonia. {{ Hisd(Emperor) }} imperial majesty thinks paying tribute will get them to leave. I have to persuade {{ him(Emperor) }} otherwise.”
“The Eshref?” Van said. “Is {{Gaykhatu}} still their chief?”
“I believe that was the name, yes. Why?”
“Send troops,” the outlander said decisively. “{{ He(Gaykhatu) }}’ll run. I knew {{ him(Gaykhatu) }} out on the plains, and {{ he(Gaykhatu) }} always did.”
“You knew {{ him(Gaykhatu) }} on the plains …” {{Valdabrun}} shook {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} head. “I won’t ask how or when, but I do give thanks for the rede—and when I talk with {{ hisd(Emperor) }} imperial majesty, I’ll term it ‘expert testimony’ or some such tripe. {{Dyaus}}, what drivel I’ve had to learn in the past year or so!”
As Van and {{Gerin}} drove away from {{Valdabrun}}'s home, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} was heavy-hearted over parting from {{Elise}}, necessary though {{ he(Gerin) }} knew it was. Van, on the other hand, was full of lickerish praise for {{Namarra}} and lewd speculation on the means {{Valdabrun}}, who was certainly no beauty, used to keep {{ her(Namarra) }} at {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} side. {{ Hisd(Valdabrun) }} sallies grew so unlikely and so comical that {{Gerin}} finally had to laugh with {{ him(Valdabrun) }}.
“Where now?” Van asked as the Alley’s turmoil surrounded them once more.
“The Sorcerers’ Collegium. It’s in the southwestern part of the city, near the apothecaries’ district. I should know when to turn.”
But {{ he(Gerin) }} did not. {{ He(Gerin) }} never learned whether the building {{ he(Gerin) }} sought as a marker was torn down or if {{ he(Gerin) }} had simply forgotten its looks in the eight years since {{ he(Gerin) }}’d seen it last. Whichever, before long {{ he(Gerin) }} knew {{ he(Gerin) }} had gone too far west along the Alley. {{ He(Gerin) }} turned to passersby for directions.
At first {{ he(Gerin) }} got no responses save shrugs and a few vaguely pointing fingers. Realizing {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mistake, {{ he(Gerin) }} tossed a copper to the first halfway intelligent-looking {{ fellow(retainer2) }} {{ he(Gerin) }} spied. The {{ man(retainer2) }}’s instructions were so artfully phrased, accompanied by such eloquent gestures, that {{Gerin}} listened as if spellbound. {{ He(Gerin) }} had all {{ he(Gerin) }} could do to keep from applauding. Instead, {{ he(Gerin) }} gave {{ hisd(Gerin) }} benefactor another coin.
The {{ man(retainer2) }}’s thanks would have drawn an aurochs into a temple.
Unfortunately, the Sorcerers’ Collegium was nowhere near where {{ he(retainer2) }} claimed. {{Gerin}} expended more coppers and most of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} patience before {{ he(Gerin) }} finally found it.
There was nothing outwardly marvelous about the building that housed it, a gray brick “island” not much different from scores of others in the capital. But it was discreetly segregated from its neighbors by a broad smooth expanse of lawn. None of the nearby buildings had a window that faced the Collegium. They only gave it blank walls of stucco, timber, or brick, perhaps fearing the sorceries emanating from it.
Though the Collegium accepted students only from within the Empire, folk of various races called on it for services. Many odd vehicles and beasts were tied in front of it; to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} horses’ alarm, {{Gerin}} hitched the wagon next to a camel some Urfa had ridden up from the desert.
No sooner had {{ he(Gerin) }} done so than three muscular individuals appeared and asked if the {{ gentlemen(Gerin) }} in the wagon would pay them to watch it. “I’ll see you in the hottest firepit in the five hells first,” {{Gerin}} said genially. “You know as well as I, the Collegium has spells to keep thieves away from its clients.”
The largest of the bravos, a {{ fellow(barbarian1) }} who would have been a giant beside anyone but Van, shrugged and grinned. “Sorry, boss,” {{ he(barbarian1) }} said, “but the two of you looked such rubes, it was worth the chance.”
“Now you know better, so be off with you.” After exchanging a final good-natured insult with the {{ baron(Gerin) }}, the ruffians ambled away, looking for less worldly folk to bilk. {{Gerin}} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. “When I was a student the same sort of rascals were about, preying on strangers.”
Inside the Collegium the ground floor was lit, mundanely enough, by torches. Some of them flared crimson, green, or blue, but that was the simplest of tricks, scarcely sorcery at all, merely involving the use of certain powdered earths. A greater magic kept the chamber free of smoke but let the nose detect the pinches of delicate incense burning in tiny braziers set along the walls and mounted on the sturdy granite columns that supported the Collegium’s upper stories.
The procedures on the ground floor of the Collegium reminded {{Gerin}} of nothing so much as those of the Imperial Bank. Orderly lines of clients snaked their way toward young mages seated at tables along the north wall. Once there, they explained their problems in low voices. Most were helped on the spot, but from time to time a {{ wizard(wizard2) }} would send one elsewhere, presumably to deal with someone more experienced.
Van bore queueing up with poor grace: “I don’t fancy all this standing about.”
“Patience,” Van said. “It’s a trick to overawe people. The longer you have to wait, the more important you think whoever you’re waiting for is.”
“Bah.” Van made as if to spit on the floor, but changed {{ hisd(Van) }} mind. It was too beautiful to soil: an abstract mosaic of tiny glass tesserae of silver, lilac, and sea-green, glittering in the torchlight.
The {{ man(harpooner) }} in front of them finally reached a {{ wizard(Avelmir) }} and poured out {{ hisd(harpooner) }} tale of woe like a spilled jug of wine, glug, glug, glug. At last the {{ wizard(Avelmir) }} exclaimed, “Enough! Enough! Follow this”—a blob of pink foxfire appeared in front of the startled {{ fellow(harpooner) }}’s nose—“and it will lead you to someone who can help you.” {{ He(Avelmir) }} turned to {{Gerin}} and Van, said courteously, “And what my I do for you gentles? You may call me {{Avelmir}}; my true name, of course, is hidden.”
{{Avelmir}} was younger than {{Gerin}}, {{ hisd(Avelmir) }} round, smooth face smiling and open. {{ Hisd(Avelmir) }} familiar, a fat gray lizard about a foot long, rested on the table in front of {{ him(Avelmir) }}. Its yellow eyes gave back {{Gerin}}'s stare unwinkingly. When {{Avelmir}} stroked its scaly skin, it arched its back in pleasure.
{{Gerin}} told {{ hisd(Gerin) }} story. When {{ he(Gerin) }} was done, {{Avelmir}}’s smile had quite gone. “You pose a difficult problem, {{ sirm(Gerin) }} {{ baron(Gerin) }}, and one in which I am not sure we can render timely assistance. Let me consult here …” {{ He(Avelmir) }} glanced down at a scrap of parchment. “We are badly understaffed, as you must be aware, and I fear we shall be unable to send anyone truly competent north of the Kirs before, hmm, seventy-five to eighty days.”
What!” {{Gerin}}'s bellow of outrage whipped heads around. “In that time I’ll be dead, with my keep and most of the northland aflame for my pyre!”
{{Avelmir}}’s manner grew chillier yet. “We find ourselves under heavy obligations in the near future, the nature of which I do not propose to discuss with you. If you do not care to wait for our services against your barbarous {{ warlock(Balamung) }}, hire some northern bungler, and may you have joy of {{ him(Balamung) }}. Good day, {{ sirm(Gerin) }}.”
“You—” Outrage choked the Fox.
The battle-gleam kindled in Van’s eyes. “Shall I break the place apart a bit, captain?”
“I would not try that,” {{Avelmir}} said quietly.
“And why not?” Van tugged at {{ hisd(Van) }} sword. It came halfway free, then struck. {{ He(Van) }} roared a curse. {{Avelmir}}’s hands writhed through passes. When {{Gerin}} tried to stop {{ him(Avelmir) }}, the reptilian familiar puffed itself up to twice its size and jumped at {{ him(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} drew back, not sure if it was venomous.
Sweat started forth on Van’s forehead, and an instant later on {{Avelmir}}’s. The outlander gained an inch, lost it again. Then more and more blade began to show. At last it jerked clear. With a howl of triumph, Van raised {{ hisd(Van) }} sword arm.
{{Gerin}} grabbed it with both hands. For a moment, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought {{ he(Gerin) }} would be lifted off the floor and swung with the blade. But reason returned to Van’s face. The outlander relaxed.
{{Avelmir}} had the look of a man who’d fished for minnows and caught a shark. Into the dead silence of the great chamber, {{ he(Gerin) }} said, “We must see if a way can be found. Follow this.”
A blue foxfire globe popped into being an inch in front of {{Gerin}}'s nose. Startled, {{ he(Gerin) }} took a step backwards. The foxfire hurried away, like somone on an important errand. {{Gerin}} and Van followed.
The ball of light led them down a steep spiral stairway into the bowels of the Collegium. {{Gerin}}'s excitement grew; here, {{ he(Gerin) }} knew, the potent sorceries were undertaken. When {{ he(Gerin) }} was a student, {{ he(Gerin) }} had been restricted to the upper floors. As the eerie guide led {{ him(Gerin) }} down echoing corridors, {{ he(Gerin) }} realized for the first time how much of the Collegium was underground—and how little {{ he(Gerin) }} had understood its true extent.
{{ He(Gerin) }} and Van passed doors without number. Most were shut; more than one bore runes of power to ensure it stayed so. Many of the open ones were innocuous: a smithy, a chamber in which glassblowers created vessels of curious shapes and sizes, a crowded library. But a winged, tailed demon thrashed within a pentacle in one room. It glared at the Fox with fiery eyes; its stench followed {{ him(Gerin) }} down the hall.
“What do you suppose would happen if we didn’t choose to follow our magical guide?” Van said.
“Nothing good, I’m sure.”
The foxfire winked out in front of a closed door. {{Gerin}} knocked; there was no reply. {{ He(Gerin) }} lifted the latch. The door silently swung open.
The chamber was far underground and held no lamps, but it was not dark. A soft silvery gleam which had no apparent source suffused it. Behind a curiously carven ebony table sat an old {{ wizard(Sosper) }} who looked up from some arcane computation when the privacy of {{ hisd(Sosper) }} cubicle was breached. {{ Hisd(Sosper) }} amber silk robes rustled as {{ he(Sosper) }} moved.
{{ He(Sosper) }} nodded to {{Gerin}} and Van. “If you need a name for me, call me {{Sosper}}.” That was clearly a pseudonym, for {{ he(Sosper) }} was no Sithonian. Though {{ hisd(Sosper) }} phrases were polished, {{ he(Sosper) }} spoke with a western accent; {{ he(Sosper) }} must have been born somewhere on the long peninsula that jutted into the Orynian Ocean.
{{ He(Sosper) }} smiled at Van. “No need to keep hand on hilt, my friend. It will avail you nothing, as I am no child in shaping spells of sealing.” The outlander, confident as always in {{ hisd(Van) }} own strength, tried to draw. {{ Hisd(Van) }} sword was frozen fast. {{Gerin}} would have believed {{Sosper}} without test; the {{ man(Sosper) }} radiated power as a bonfire radiates heat.
Gentle but overwhelmingly self-assured, {{Sosper}} cut off the {{ baron(Gerin) }} when {{ he(Gerin) }} began to speak. “Why do you question {{Avelmir}}’s judgment? I can give you no aid, nor can the Collegium, until the time {{ he(Avelmir) }} specified. What happens among barbarians is of little moment to us in any event, and less now. You may perhaps be able to deduce the reason, having once studied here. No, look not so startled, my young friend: who knows the chick better than the hen?”
Trying to master {{ hisd(Gerin) }} surprise, {{Gerin}} turned {{ hisd(Gerin) }} wits to the problem {{Sosper}} had set {{ him(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} found no solution, and said so.
“Do you not? A pity. In that case, there appears to be no need for further conversation. Leave me, I pray, so I may return to my calculations.”
“At least tell me why you will not aid me,” {{Gerin}} said. “{{Balamung}} is no ordinary mage; {{ he(Balamung) }} has more power than any I’ve seen here.”
For the first time, {{Sosper}} spoke with a touch of asperity. “I am under no obligation to you, {{ sirm(Gerin) }}; rather the reverse, for you take me away from important matters. And as for your Trokmê, I care not if {{ he(Balamung) }} has the Book of Shabeth-Shiri—”
“{{ He(Balamung) }} has. You don’t seem to have listened to a word I said.”
“How can you know this? Have you seen its terrible glow with your own eyes?” {{Sosper}} was skeptical, almost contemptuous.
“No, but I spoke with a woodsrunner who has.”
“You accept the untrained observations of a savage as fact? My good {{ man(Gerin) }}, a hundred generations of scriers have sought the Book of Shabeth-Shiri—in vain. I doubt a barbarian hedge-{{ wizard(Balamung) }} could have found it where they failed. No, lost it is and lost it shall remain, until the one no grave shall hold brings it back to the world of men.”
{{Gerin}} had not heard that bit of lore before. It chilled {{ him(Gerin) }} to the marrow. But {{ hisd(Gerin) }} protests died unspoken. The old {{ man(Sosper) }} before {{ him(Gerin) }} had been right for so long, and grown so arrogant in {{ hisd(Sosper) }} rightness, that now {{ he(Sosper) }} could not hear anything that contradicted {{ hisd(Sosper) }} set image of the world. {{ He(Sosper) }} was talented, brilliant … and deafened by {{ hisd(Sosper) }} own rigidity.
“Leave me,” {{Sosper}} said. It was order, not request. Followed close by Van, {{Gerin}} left the chamber. Ice was in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} heart. The door swung closed behind them of its own accord. Like a faithful servant, the foxfire ball reappeared to guide them back to its creator.
On their return, {{Avelmir}} looked to be considering some remark at their expense, but {{Gerin}}'s stony visage and an ominous twitch of Van’s great forearm muscles persuaded {{ him(Avelmir) }} to hold {{ hisd(Avelmir) }} tongue.
“What now, captain?” the outlander asked as they left the Collegium.
{{Gerin}} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head in dejected bewilderment. “Great {{Dyaus}} above, how should I know? Every move I make rams my head into a stone wall: the {{Sibyl}}, {{Carus}}, now this. Maybe {{Balamung}} was right. Maybe I can do nothing to fight {{ him(Balamung) }}. Still, I intend to go on trying—what else can I do? And I can do one thing for myself right now.”
“What’s that?”
“Get drunk.”
Van slapped {{ him(Gerin) }} on the back, sending {{ him(Gerin) }} staggering down the steps. “Best notion I’ve heard in days. Where do we find a place?”
“It shouldn’t be hard.” Nor was it. Not five minutes’ ride from the Collegium stood a small tavern, set between an apothecary’s shop and an embalmer—“Where the druggist sends {{ hisd(northerner) }} mistakes, I suppose,” {{Gerin}} said. {{ He(Gerin) }} read the faded sign over the tavern door. “‘The {{ Baron(Gerin) }}s’ Roost.’ Hah! Anything that roosted here would come away with lice in its feathers.”
“Someone doesn’t seem to care.” Van pointed to the matched blooded dapples and fine chariot tied in front of the tavern.
“Someone must be slumming.” {{Gerin}} slid down and hitched the wagon next to the fancy rig.
The {{ Baron(Gerin) }}s’ Roost had no door, only a splotchily dyed curtain, once perhaps forest green. Inside, it was dirty, dark, and close. Its few patrons, from the look of them mostly burglars, pimps, and other small-time grifters, gave {{Gerin}} and Van a wary once-over before returning to their low-voiced talk. “Hemp for smoking?” {{Gerin}} heard one say to another. “I can get it for you, of course I can. How much do you want?”
“What can I give you friends?” asked the fat {{ man(innkeeper) }} behind the bar. {{ Hisd(innkeeper) }} hard eyes gave the lie to the jovial air {{ he(innkeeper) }} tried to cultivate.
“Wine,” {{Gerin}} said. “And quiet.”
“The quiet’s free. For the wine, I’d see your silver first.”
Van laughed at that. “Show too much silver in a dive like this and half the jackals here’ll decide they’re wolves today.”
“They don’t seem to be troubling {{ him(Rihwin) }}, do they?” The taverner jerked a thumb at the noble slumped over the far corner of the bar. Three jars of various vintages stood before {{ him(Rihwin) }}; from {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} slack-jointed posture they were empty, or nearly so.
“For all I know, {{ he(Rihwin) }}’s one of them, or their boss,” Van said.
At that, the noble slowly swung round. A golden earring caught candlelight and glinted. “Who is it,” {{ he(Rihwin) }} asked loftily, “who dares impute me a part of this place in any way save my location?” A swacked grin spread across {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} face as {{ he(Rihwin) }} focused on {{Gerin}} and Van. “As I live and breathe, the {{ wench(Elise) }}-stealers!”
“Rihwin! What are you doing here?” {{Gerin}} exclaimed.
“I? I am becoming preternaturally drunk, though if I can still say preter—pre—that word, I have not yet arrived. I shall be honored to stand you gentles a round: anyone filching so luscious a {{ lass(Elise) }} as {{Elise}} from {{Wolfar}} of the Axe deserves reward. Yet after {{ she(Elise) }} was gone, what point to my staying in the north—especially as my welcome had worn rather thin? So three days later, home I fared, and here I am.”
Considering it, {{Gerin}} decided it was quite possible; Rihwin would have taken no side-trips to delay {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} journey. With {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} load of cares, the Fox was glad to see any face {{ he(Gerin) }} knew. {{ He(Gerin) }} answered, “You can buy for us if we can buy for you.”
“Fair enough.” Rihwin turned to the tapster. “A double measure of Siphnian for my comrades, and quickly! They have considerable overtaking to do.”
The wine the taverner brought had never seen Siphnos, and the amphora in which it came was a crude local imitation of Sithonian ware. At any other time, {{Gerin}} would have stalked out of the dive. Now {{ he(Gerin) }} relished the warmth rising from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} belly to {{ his(Gerin) }} brain. When the vessel was empty {{ he(Gerin) }} ordered another, then another.
No amateur toper {{ himself(Rihwin) }}, Rihwin watched in disbelief as Van poured down mug after mug of wine. “Heaven above and hells below!” {{ he(Rihwin) }} exclaimed. “I toast your capacity.” The three friends drained their cups.

“And I your fine company,” Van said. The cups emptied again. Riwhin and Van looked expectantly at {{Gerin}}.
{{ He(Gerin) }} raised {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mug. “A murrain take all magicians.” {{ He(Gerin) }} drank.
Van drank.
“All but me,” Rihwin said. {{ He(Rihwin) }} drank too.
“What’s that?” {{Gerin}} was abruptly half sober.
What’s—arp!—what? Excuse me, I pray, I am not well.” Riwhin’s head flopped onto {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} arms. {{ He(Rihwin) }} slept. {{Gerin}} shook, prodded, and nudged {{ him(Rihwin) }}, to no avail. The southerner muttered and whimpered, but would not wake.
“We’ve got to get {{ him(Rihwin) }} out of here,” the Fox told Van.
Van stared owlishly. “Who out of where?”
“Not you too!” {{Gerin}} snarled. “Before {{ he(Rihwin) }} flickered out, this candle said {{ he(Rihwin) }} was a {{ wizard(Rihwin) }}.”
“A murrain take all {{ wizard(Rihwin) }}s!” Van shouted. {{ He(Van) }} drank.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} tried to whip {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fuzzy wits into action. At last {{ he(Gerin) }} smote fist into palm in satisfaction. “I’d wager you think you’re quite the strong {{ fellow(Van) }},” {{ he(Gerin) }} said to Van.
“I am that,” the outlander allowed between swigs. “And sober, too.”
“I doubt it,” {{Gerin}} said. “In fact, I’d bet you’re too puny and too drunk even to carry this {{ chap(Rihwin) }} here”—he indicated the inert Rihwin—“out to the wagon.”
“Go howl, captain.” Van slung Rihwin over {{ hisd(Van) }} shoulder like an empty suit of clothes and headed for the door. {{Gerin}} paid the taverner and followed.
Van slung Rihwin into the back of the wagon so hard {{Gerin}} hoped the noble was unhurt. “Will you own you were wrong?” {{ he(Van) }} said.
“It seems I have to,” {{Gerin}} answered, smiling inside.
“Pay up, then.”
“Tell you what: I’ll race you back to Turgis’, double or nothing. You take the wagon and I’ll drive Rihwin’s chariot.”
“Doesn’t seem quite fair,” Van complained.
Privately, {{Gerin}} would have agreed. {{ He(Gerin) }} loaded {{ hisd(Gerin) }} voice with scorn. “Not game, eh?”
“You’ll see!” Van untied the wagon from the hitching rail, leaped aboard. {{ He(Van) }} cracked {{ hisd(Van) }} whip and was gone. {{Gerin}} was right behind {{ him(Van) }}. Pedestrians fled every which way, tumbling back into shops and displays for their lives.
Rihwin’s team was as fine as it looked, but the Fox still had trouble gaining on Van. The outlander, with more weight behind {{ him(Van) }}, bulled through holes {{Gerin}} had to avoid. {{ He(Van) }} also drove with utter disregard for life and limb, {{ hisd(Van) }} own or anyone else’s.
They were neck and neck when they reached the Alley. They stormed down it. And then, right outside the wheat emporium, they descended on a great flock of geese being driven to slaughter. {{Gerin}} doubted it was the flock which had delayed them on their way to the capital. That one still had to be on the road.
Van never slowed down. {{ He(Van) }} had time for one bellowed “Gangway!” before {{ he(Van) }} was into the middle of the geese, {{Gerin}} still a length or two behind. The Fox glimpsed blank despair on the face of one goose-tender. Then the air was full of terrified honking, squealing, cackling, defecating big white birds.
Some flew into the grain market. They promptly began to devour the wheat there. Swearing merchants tried to drive them back into the street, only to retreat in dismay as the birds fought back with buffeting wings and savage pecks and bites.
Half a dozen geese flapped their way through the second-story window of a bath-house. An instant later, four nude {{ men(Gerin) }} leaped out the same window.
A dun-colored hound contested the right of two geese to a cartload of peaches. When five more birds joined the fray, the dog ran off, tail between its legs. Squawking contentedly, the victors settled down to enjoy their spoils.
Yet another goose seized a trollop’s filmy skirt in its beak. The goose tore it from her legs and left her half naked in the roadway. Her curses only added to the turmoil.
Somehow or other, the racers got through. Any pursuit was lost in the gallinaceous stampede. {{Gerin}} took the lead for a moment, then lost it when Van, quite by accident, found a shortcut. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} was gaining at the end, but Van pulled into Turgis’ forecourt a few seconds in front.
Plucking a feather from {{ hisd(Van) }} {{ beard(Van) }}, {{ he(Van) }} walked over to the Fox, broad palm out. “Pay up, if you please.”
“You know, we forgot to set a stake. I owe you twice nothing, which, the subtle Sithonians assure us, remains nothing.”
Van pondered this, nodded reluctantly. “Then we’ll just have to race back,” {{ he(Van) }} declared. {{ He(Van) }} took two steps toward the wagon and fell on {{ hisd(Van) }} face.
The pound of galloping hooves brought Turgis out {{ hisd(Turgis) }} front door on the run. “What in the name of the gods is going on?” {{ he(Turgis) }} shouted. “Oh, it’s you, {{Gerin}}. I might have known.”
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} lacked the patience to trade gibes with {{ him(Turgis) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} boiled with urgency. “Do you have a potion to sober up these two right away?” {{ He(Gerin) }} nodded toward Van and Rihwin, whom {{ he(Gerin) }} had lain beside {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend. The noble had stayed unconscious all through the wild ride.
“Aye, but they’ll not be happier for it.” Turgis vanished into the hostel. {{ He(Turgis) }} returned a moment later with a small, tightly stoppered vial. {{ He(Turgis) }} poured half its contents into Van, gave the rest to Rihwin.
As the drug took effect, the two of them thrashed like broken-backed things, then spewed their guts on the ground. Sudden reason showed in Rihwin’s eyes. Wiping {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} mouth, {{ he(Rihwin) }} asked, “What am I doing here? Where, for that matter, is here? Who do you think you are, my good {{ man(Van) }}?” {{ he(Rihwin) }} added when Van, still in pain, rolled up against {{ him(Rihwin) }}. {{ Hisd(Rihwin) }} voice showed much of {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} usual cheerful hauteur.
The outlander groaned. “With any luck, I’ll die before I remember. There’s an earthquake in my brains.”
Rihwin rose gingerly. {{ He(Rihwin) }} looked from Van, who stayed on the ground with head in hands, to {{Gerin}}, none too steady on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} feet {{ himself(Gerin) }}. “I congratulate you, my friends: practice has made you a superior pair of kidnappers. Tell me, which of you has wed {{Elise}}, and which intends to marry me? I confess, I have given little thought to my dowry.”
“Go howl!” {{Gerin}} said. “Tell me at once: is it true you’re a {{ wizard(Rihwin) }}?”
“Where did you learn that, in that horrid dive? How drunk was I? It were better to say I am all but a mage. I completed the course at the Collegium but never graduated, nor was I linked to a familiar.”
“Why not?”
“Of what interest is this to you, may I ask?”
“Rihwin, you will have my story, I promise you,” {{Gerin}} said. “Now tell me yours, before I throttle you.”
“Very well. The fault, I fear, was my own. I learned all the required lores, mastered the spells they set me, met every examination, completed each conjuration with adequate results—which is to say, no fiend swallowed me up. And all this I accomplished on my own, for {{ he(Sosper) }} who nominally supervised my work was so concerned with {{ hisd(Sosper) }} own goetic researches that {{ he(Sosper) }} had scant moments to lavish on {{ hisd(Sosper) }} pupils.”
“Not the {{ wizard(Sosper) }} who styles {{ himself(Sosper) }} {{Sosper}}?” {{Gerin}} asked.
“Indeed yes. How could you know that?”
“I’ve met the {{ man(Sosper) }}. Go on, please.”
“Came the night before I was to be consecrated mage, and in my folly I resolved to repay my mentor for all {{ hisd(Sosper) }} indifference. {{ He(Sosper) }} is a {{ man(Sosper) }} who likes the good life, is {{Sosper}}, for all {{ hisd(Sosper) }} sorcerous craft, and {{ he(Sosper) }} dwells near the Palace Imperial. At midnight I essayed a small summoning. When the demon I evoked appeared, I charged it to go to my {{ master(Sosper) }}’s bedchamber, give {{ hisd(Sosper) }} couch a hearty shake, and vanish instanter once {{ he(Sosper) }} awoke. What I ordained, the demon did.”
A reminiscent grin lit Rihwin’s face. “Oh, it was a lovely jape! Even warlocks are muzzy when bounced from slumber, and {{Sosper}}, suspecting nothing other than a common earthquake, rushed in {{ hisd(Sosper) }} nightshirt to the palace to inquire after the {{Emperor}}’s safety. I would have given half my lands to see {{ hisd(Sosper) }} face when {{ he(Sosper) }} found the temblor {{ hisd(Sosper) }} private property.
“But it takes a mighty mage to befool such a {{ man(Sosper) }} for long, and I, alas, had nowhere near the skill to maintain my appearance of innocence ’gainst {{ hisd(Sosper) }} inquiry. Which leaves me here … almost a mage, and glad, I suppose, my punishment was no worse than expulsion.”
Rihwin’s tale was in keeping with the judgment {{Gerin}} had formed of {{ him(Sosper) }} at {{Ricolf}}’s holding: a {{ man(Sosper) }} who would dare anything on the impulse of a moment, never stopping to consider the consequences—but one who would then jauntily bear those consequences, whatever they were.
Banking on that mercurial nature, {{Gerin}} plunged into {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own tale. “And so,” {{ he(Gerin) }} finished, “I found I could get no proper mage, and was in despair, not knowing what to do. Meeting you in the tavern seems nothing less than the intervention of the gods—and on my behalf, for once. Fare north with me, to be my aid against the Trokmoi.”
Rihwin studied {{ him(Gerin) }}, wearing {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} usual expression of amused cynicism like a gambler’s stiff face. “You know, I suppose, that I have every right to bear you ill-will for winning the love of a {{ girl(Elise) }} for whose hand I struggled over the course of a year?”
“So you do,” {{Gerin}} said stonily.
“And you know I find your northern province uncouth, unmannered, and violent, nothing at all like this soft, smiling land?”
“Rihwin, if you mean no, say no and stop twisting the knife!”
“But my dear {{ fellow(Gerin) }} Fox, I am trying to say yes!”
“What?” {{Gerin}} stared at {{ him(Rihwin) }}.
“Why do you think I traveled north a year ago, if not for the adventure of it, and the change? I was stifled by the insipid life I led here; were it not that I am in a bad odor up there, I doubt I should have returned at all.”
Van struggled to {{ hisd(Van) }} feet. “Good for you! Keep the same ground under your feet too long and you grow roots like a radish.”
“But—what you said of {{Elise}} …” {{Gerin}} was floundering now.
“What of it? That I lost {{ her(Elise) }} was my own foolish fault, and none other’s. I was not in love with {{ her(Elise) }}, nor {{ she(Elise) }} with me. Aye, {{ she(Elise) }}’s a comely {{ maid(Elise) }}, but I’ve found there are a good many of those, and most of them like me well. I entered {{Ricolf}}’s contest much more to measure myself against the other suitors than for {{ herd(Elise) }} sake.”
The last of {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} foppish mask slipped away, and {{ he(Rihwin) }} spoke with a seriousness the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had never heard from {{ him(Rihwin) }}: “{{ Lord(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}, if you truly want my aid, I will meet you here in three days’ time, ready to travel. I pray your pardon for not being quicker, but as I’m here, I should set my affairs in order before faring north again. Does it please you?”
Dumbfounded, {{Gerin}} could only nod. Rihwin sketched a salute, climbed into {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} chariot, and departed. {{ Hisd(Rihwin) }} horses whickered happily at the familiar feel of {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} hands on the reins.
“What do you know?” Van said. “More to that {{ fellow(Rihwin) }} than {{ he(Rihwin) }} lets on.”
{{Gerin}} was thinking much the same thing. It occurred to {{ him(Gerin) }} that {{ he(Gerin) }} had seen Rihwin only on a couple of the worst days of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} life; now {{ he(Gerin) }} began to understand why {{Ricolf}}, with longer acquaintance, had thought the southerner a fit match for {{Elise}}.
More than once over those three days, the Fox wondered if Rihwin would have second thoughts, but {{ he(Gerin) }} was too busy readying {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own return to waste much time on worry. Van acquired a stout ash spear (“A little light, but what can you do?”) and four examples of another weapon {{Gerin}} had not seen before: flat rings of bronze with sharp outer edges. Their central holes were sized so they fit snugly onto the out-lander’s forearms.
“They’re called chakrams,” Van explained. “I learned the use of them in Mabalal. They’re easier to throw straight than knives, and if I just leave them where they are, they make a forearm smash unpleasant for whoever’s in the way.”
When the {{ baron(Gerin) }} paid Turgis, the innkeeper put an arm round {{ hisd(Gerin) }} shoulder. “You’re a good friend, Fox. I’m sorry to see you go. You remind me of the days when I still had hair on my pate. Please note, however, you brigand, I am not so sorry as to make you any rash promises. The last one cost me dear enough.”
Rihwin arrived on the morning {{ he(Rihwin) }} had set, and as ready as {{ he(Rihwin) }} had vowed. Gone was {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} thin toga; {{ he(Rihwin) }} wore a leather tunic and baggy woolen {{ trousers(Rihwin) }}. A sword swung at {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} hip, armor and a quiver of javelins were stowed behind {{ him(Rihwin) }}, and {{ he(Rihwin) }} had set a battered bronze helm on {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} curls. {{ Hisd(Rihwin) }} left ear, though, still sported a golden ring. “It’s possible to ask too much of me, you know,” {{ he(Rihwin) }} said sheepishly when {{Gerin}} pointed at it.
“Rihwin, for all I care, you can wear the damned thing in your nose. Let’s be off.”
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} drove the wagon up the Alley. Van stayed in the rear compartment, out of sight. {{Gerin}} did not want to be stopped by some irate merchant who’d had {{ hisd(merchant) }} goods smashed or scattered in the wild ride and now recognized one of its perpetrators. {{ He(Gerin) }} was confident {{ he(Gerin) }} was immune from being identified so; save for {{ hisd(Gerin) }} northern dress, {{ he(Gerin) }} looked like just another Elabonian. Thus it came as a small shock when someone waved frantically and called {{ hisd(Gerin) }} name.
“{{Elise}}!” {{ he(Gerin) }} said. “Great {{Dyaus}} above, what now?”
<h2>IX</h2>
{{Elise}}’s story was simple enough, if unpleasing. {{Valdabrun}}’s delight at guesting {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }} unknown {{ niece(Elise) }} had faded. The fading quickened when {{ he(Valdabrun) }} realized how cordially {{Elise}} and {{Namarra}} despised each other.
“It all blew up at dawn this morning in a glorious fight,” {{Elise}} said. {{ She(Elise) }} reached into a pocket of {{ herd(Elise) }} traveling coat and brought out a lock of {{Namarra}}’s fiery hair. “Black at the roots, you’ll notice.”
“May I be of service, my {{ lady(Elise) }}?” Rihwin asked. “A spell for an enemy’s ruin is easy when one has a lock of hair with which to work.”
“I know enough magic for that myself,” {{Gerin}} said, not wanting Rihwin to help {{Elise}} in any way at all.
“The snit hardly merits being blasted from the face of the earth simply because {{ she(Namarra) }} and I don’t get along,” {{Elise}} said. {{ She(Elise) }} asked Rihwin, “How is it you are in the city, and in {{Gerin}}'s company?”
{{ He(Rihwin) }} briefly explained. {{ She(Elise) }} said, “When last I saw you—and more of you than I wanted to, I’ll have you know—I would have thought you’d never want to go back to the northlands again.”
{{ He(Rihwin) }} flinched at that, but answered, “They hold no terror for me, so long as I am not required to face your {{ father(Ricolf) }}.”
“Where shall I take you now?” {{Gerin}} asked {{Elise}}. “You must have other kin here.”
“I do, but I know none of them by name. Nor would it do me much good if I did. My {{ uncle(Valdabrun) }} is not a {{ man(Valdabrun) }} to use half-measures. {{ He(Valdabrun) }} swore {{ he(Valdabrun) }}’d make sure I was no more welcome in any of their houses than in {{ hisd(Valdabrun) }}. That leaves me little choice but to travel north with you.”
{{Gerin}} realized {{ she(Elise) }} was right.
“Get moving, will you, and talk later,” Van said from {{ hisd(Van) }} comfortless perch in the back of the wagon. “I feel like an ostrich in a robin’s egg.”
Once they were out of the city, {{ he(Van) }} emerged from confinement and stretch till {{ hisd(Van) }} joints creaked. “Let me ride with you a while, Rihwin,” {{ he(Van) }} said. “I like the bounce of a chariot under my feet.”
“Do you indeed?” Rihwin said. {{ He(Rihwin) }} flicked the whip over {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} matched dapples. They leaped forward, sending the light car bounding into the air whenever its bronze-shod wheels struck a stone set an inch or two higher in the roadbed than its fellows. Van was unruffled. {{ He(Van) }} shifted {{ hisd(Van) }} weight with marvelous quickness, not deigning to clutch at the chariot’s handrail.
Rihwin gave up after a wild quarter of a mile, slowing {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} horses to a walk. As {{Gerin}} caught up, {{ he(Gerin) }} asked {{Elise}}, “Does {{ he(Rihwin) }} always act so?”
“I’ve rarely seen {{ him(Rihwin) }} otherwise. The day {{ he(Rihwin) }} came to court me, {{ he(Rihwin) }} stepped down from {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} car, kissed me, then kissed my {{ father(Ricolf) }} twice as hard! But {{ he(Rihwin) }} has such charm and nonchalance that the outrageous things {{ he(Rihwin) }} does don’t grate as they would from someone else.”
“What, ah, do you think of {{ him(Rihwin) }}?” {{Gerin}} asked carefully.
“As a possible {{ husband(Rihwin) }}, you mean? I could have done much worse.” {{ She(Elise) }} laid a hand on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} arm. “But I could do much better, too, and I think I have.”
Guard duty was easier to bear with three fighters to carry the load. Golden Math, a waning crescent, had been in the sky when Rihwin woke {{Gerin}} to stand the third watch. Elleb, three days past full, was nearing the meridian; Tiwaz had just set.
“Tell me, how is it you know sorcery?” Rihwin asked. To {{Gerin}}, {{ he(Rihwin) }} seemed to be saying, How could a backwoodsman like you hope to master such a subtle art?
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} had met that attitude from southerners too often during {{ hisd(Gerin) }} first stay in the capital. Touched on an old sore spot, {{ he(Gerin) }} said shortly, “Surprising as it may seem, I spent two years studying in the city, including a turn at the Collegium, though a short one.”
“Did you really? What did you study besides mage-craft?” Far from being condescending, Riwhin showed eager interest.
“Natural philosophy, mostly, and history.”
“History? Great {{Dyaus}} above, {{ man(Gerin) }}, did you ever hear Maleinos lecture?”
“Yes, often. {{ He(wizard1) }} interested me.”
“What do you think of {{ hisd(wizard1) }} cyclical notion of historical development? I was so impressed by the peroration {{ he(wizard1) }} always used that I memorized it: ‘Peoples and cities now have great success, now are so totally defeated as no longer to exist. And the changing circuit revealed such things before our time, and will reveal them again, and the revelations will not cease, so long as there be men and battles.’ And {{ he(wizard1) }} would stalk off, like an angry {{ god(wizard1) }}.”
“Yes, and do you know where {{ he(wizard1) }}’d go?” {{Gerin}} said: “To a little tavern close by, to drink resinated wine—how do Sithonians stand the stuff?—for hours on end.”
Rihwin looked pained. “You just shattered one of my few remaining illusions.”
“I’m not saying {{ he(wizard1) }}’s not a brilliant {{ man(wizard1) }}. I do think {{ he(wizard1) }} presents {{ hisd(wizard1) }} ideas too forcefully, though, and makes too little allowance for variations and exceptions to {{ his(wizard1) }} rules.”
“I can’t quite agree with you there.…” All but oblivious to their surroundings, they fenced with ideas, arguing in low voices until Rihwin exclaimed, “Is it growing light already?”
They made good progress the next day, and the next, and the next, reaching the Pranther River at the end of the fourth day out of the capital. They camped near its southern bank.
The night was quiet, save for the river’s gentle murmur. Pale clouds drifted lazily from west to east, obscuring now the pale thin waxing crescent of Nothos, now Tiwaz’s bright full face, now rosy Elleb, which came into the sky halfway through the mid-watch. {{Gerin}}, whose watch that was, endured the muttering of the ghosts for another couple of hours, then nudged Van.
{{ Hisd(Gerin) }} friend woke with a thrash. “Anything happening?” {{ he(Van) }} asked.
“Not so you’d notice,” {{Gerin}} said.
“Aye, it seems restful enough.” Van looked down. “What’s this? Look what I’ve been all but sleeping on, captain—another aoratos plant.” {{ He(Van) }} plucked it from the ground.
{{Gerin}} eyed it with distaste. “Now that I’m only standing one watch in three I don’t need anything to keep me awake at night, and the leaves are so bitter they shrivel my tongue. Throw it away.”
“I’d sooner not. I want to see if Rihwin knows of it.”
“Suit yourself. As for me, I can hardly keep my eyes open.”
It was still nearly dark when Van woke {{ him(Gerin) }}. “Something moved over by the river, behind that stand of brush,” the outlander whispered. “I couldn’t quite make out what it was, but I don’t like it.”
“Let’s have a look.” Grabbing for sword and {{ trousers(Gerin) }}, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} slid out of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bedroll. {{ He(Gerin) }} roused {{Elise}} and Rihwin, told them to give {{ him(Gerin) }} and Van a few minutes and then to use their own judgment. Then {{ he(Gerin) }} slipped on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} helm and followed Van down toward the Pranther.
As always, the Fox marveled at Van’s uncanny ability to pick {{ hisd(Van) }} way through undergrowth. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} own woodscraft was better than most, but once or twice an arm or shoulder brushed a branch hard enough to make it rustle. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} comrade made never a sound.
Van froze when {{ he(Van) }} came to the edge of the brush. A moment later {{Gerin}} eased up beside {{ him(Van) }}, following with {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eyes the outlander’s pointing finger. “Trokmoi!” {{ he(Van) }} hissed, hand tightening of itself on swordhilt.
A pair of the barbarians sprawled by the riverbank. Their attention seemed focused on the stream. Their tunics were not checked in the usual northern fashion, but were all over fylfots. These were {{Balamung}}’s {{ men(barbarian1) }}!
But they did not move, not even when {{Gerin}} parted the curtain of bushes and walked toward them. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} bafflement grew with every step. {{ He(Gerin) }} came up close behind them, and still they were oblivious. Then {{ he(Gerin) }} bent down and prodded one of them.
The Trokmê toppled. {{ He(barbarian1) }} was dead, {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} face an agonized rictus. In {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} throat stood an unfletched wooden dart, half its length stained with an orange paste. A matching dart was in {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} companion’s unmoving chest. A fat green trout lay between the Trokmoi, bone hook still set in its mouth.
“What in the gods’ holy names—!” Van burst out.
A grim smile formed on {{Gerin}}'s face. “I do believe the riverfolk have done us a good turn,” {{ he(Gerin) }} said. “Can you think of any reason {{Balamung}} would send {{ men(barbarian1) }} south, except to hunt us? And here, almost up with their prey, they stopped to do a little fishing—in the one river in all Elabon folk don’t fish.” {{ He(Gerin) }} explained how the riverfolk had come to the Pranther.
Van shook {{ hisd(Van) }} head. “Poor damned fools, to die for a trout. But it will make us a fine breakfast.” {{ He(Van) }} stooped to pick up the fish.
{{Gerin}} grabbed {{ hisd(Van) }} arm and stopped {{ him(Van) }}. A reptilian head was watching them from the river. No expression was readable in the river{{ man(barbarian1) }}’s unwinking amber eyes, but {{ he(barbarian1) }} held an envenomed dart ready to throw.
“All right, keep the blasted thing!” Van flung the trout into the Pranther. The river{{ man(barbarian1) }} dove after it, surfacing a moment later with it in one webbed hand. A grave nod and {{ he(barbarian1) }} was gone.
“What’s toward?” Riwhin called from the bushes. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} was glad to see {{ he(Riwhin) }}’d had sense enough to don armor and to carry {{ hisd(Riwhin) }} bow with an arrow nocked and ready. {{ He(Gerin) }} was a good deal less glad to see {{Elise}} behind Rihwin; {{ he(Gerin) }} wished {{ she(Elise) }} wouldn’t always run toward trouble. Frowning, {{ he(Gerin) }} told them what had happened.
Rihwin said, “That Trokmê must hate you indeed, to work so hard for your destruction. Or perhaps {{ he(Balamung) }} fears you.”
{{Gerin}} laughed bitterly. “Why should {{ he(Balamung) }}? I doubt I’m more than a pebble underfoot to {{ him(Balamung) }}—a sharp pebble, aye, but a pebble nonetheless.”
Hooves thuttered on the bridge called Dalassenos’ Revenge. Rihwin half drew {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} bow, expecting more Trokmoi. But it was only a dour courier in the black and gold of the Empire, a leather message pouch slung over one shoulder. {{ He(courier) }} headed south fast as {{ hisd(courier) }} lathered horses would take {{ him(courier) }}. “Make way!” {{ he(courier) }} shouted, though no one blocked {{ him(courier) }}.
“Just once,” {{Gerin}} said, “I’d like to see one of them have more to say than ‘Make way!’ It’s no more likely than a wolf climbing trees, though.”
The Fox disliked Elabon’s courier corps. All the barons north of the Kirs saw it as part of the thin web binding them to the Empire, and they were right. The couriers carried news faster than anyone else, but only on imperial business.
Later that day another courier came south at the same headlong pace. {{Gerin}} called after {{ him(harpooner) }} for news. {{ He(Gerin) }} got none. They refused even to gossip, fearing it might somehow compromise them. Cursing, {{Gerin}} hurried {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own northward pace.
Rihwin, as it happened, did not know of the aoratos plant or its uses. “And that is passing strange,” {{ he(Rihwin) }} said, “for I thought surely the Collegium’s herbalists were aware of the properties of every plant that grows within the Empire.” {{ He(Rihwin) }} took the little bush from Van and studied it. “I must say it seems ordinary.”
“Which is likely why no one’s bothered with it here,” Van said. “On the plains it stands out a good deal more.”
“I must try it tonight,” Rihwin said.
“The taste is foul,” {{Gerin}} warned {{ him(Rihwin) }}.
“What if it is? If the effects are as interesting as claimed, I may be on the brink of discovering a whole new vice.” {{ He(Rihwin) }} gave a voluptuary’s leer, but spoiled it by winking.
“If you were half the carpet knight you pretend to be, you’d have debauched yourself to death years ago,” {{Gerin}} said.
“And if you were as sour as you let on, you’d long since have pickled in your own juice,” Rihwin retorted, a shot with so much justice that {{Gerin}} chuckled and owned {{ himself(Gerin) }} beaten.
{{ He(Gerin) }} stood first watch that night. By sunset {{ he(Gerin) }} had grown so edgy that {{ he(Gerin) }} decided to chew some aoratos leaves {{ himself(Gerin) }}, regardless of their flavor. {{ He(Gerin) }} felt fatigue flow away as the juice coursed through {{ hisd(Gerin) }} veins. The curious extra sense the plant conferred showed {{ him(Gerin) }} a squirrel asleep in its nest high in an aspen tree, a fox stalking a vole, a nightjar whipping after fluttering moths. The ghosts seemed troubled; thanks to {{ his(Gerin) }} added perception, {{Gerin}} could almost make out the cause of their alarm, but in the end it eluded {{ him(Gerin) }}.
{{ He(Gerin) }} did not know whether {{ he(Gerin) }}’d swallowed more leaves this time or this was a more potent aoratos, but its effects were still strong in {{ him(Gerin) }} when {{ he(Gerin) }} woke Rihwin. They made the {{ baron(Gerin) }} reluctant to seek sleep at once. {{ He(Gerin) }} was also curious to learn what the southerner would think of the plant.
“Pah!” Rihwin almost choked on the first mouthful, but choked it down. “A gourmet’s delight it is not.” {{ He(Rihwin) }} chewed more leaves. A few minutes passed. {{ Hisd(Rihwin) }} breath began to whistle more quickly through {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} nostrils. {{ Hisd(Rihwin) }} voice grew soft and dreamy. “How bright Tiwaz is, like polished silver!” After another moment: “Is that a ferret over there, {{Gerin}}?” {{ He(Rihwin) }} pointed into the darkness.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} felt {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own mind reach out. “I think it is.”
“Remarkable. And the ghosts—hear them wail!”
They talked idly for a while, trying with scant success to find some everday sensation comparable to that induced by the aoratos. “This is foolishness,” {{Gerin}} said at last. “If there were half a dozen things like it, it would not be marvelous at all.”
“Astutely reasoned,” Rihwin answered, {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} tone mildly sarcastic. “From that, it would follow—” {{ He(Rihwin) }} paused in mid-sentenced, exclaimed, “The ghosts are gone!”
They were, fled away as suddenly and completely as if driven to shelter by the rising sun. The gloom outside the campfire’s glow seemed somehow strange and flat. Surrounded by this great stillness, the cry of a hunting owl came shockingly loud.
{{Gerin}}'s surprised senses were still groping for an explanation when Rihwin, now feeling the aoratos more strongly than did the {{ baron(Gerin) }}, whispered, “I know why they fled. Look north.”
Looking was not what was required, but {{Gerin}} understood. The blood froze in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} veins as {{ he(Gerin) }} sensed the approaching demon. Only the aoratos plant let {{ him(Gerin) }} do so; without it, the flying monster would have stayed unseen, undetected, until it descended on the travelers like a hawk stooping on roosting fowl.
The huge demon drew swiftly nearer, like a stone hurled from a god’s hand. Even with the aoratos, its shape was hard to define. {{Gerin}} was most reminded of the jellyfish that floated in the Greater Inner Sea, but the analogy was imperfect, for {{Balamung}}’s sending—the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had no doubt it was such—surveyed with three bright, pitiless eyes the landscape over which it sailed. For mouth it had a rasping sucker disk, set with hundreds of tiny curved teeth. The edges of its gross body blurred and wavered, like a stone seen through running water.
Still, while in this plane it had to be vulnerable to weapons, however fearsome its appearance. Though fear gripped {{ him(Gerin) }}, {{Gerin}} strung {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bow and set an arrow in it. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} fingers worked more of themselves than under {{ hisd(Gerin) }} conscious direction.
But the demon halted well out of bowshot. The {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s heart sank. {{ He(Gerin) }} saw no way to lure it into range before it began a killing rush too swift to give {{ him(Gerin) }} a good shot. Whistling tunelessly, Rihwin glanced from bow to demon.
The creature gave no sign of immediate attack. It seemed as uncertain as the people it faced. Words formed in the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s mind: “How do you know of me? The {{ man(Balamung) }}-thing who sent me forth promised easy meat, not warriors with weapons to hand.”
For no reason {{Gerin}} understood, Rihwin was grinning. “Nor is that the only way in which your {{ master(Balamung) }} deceived you,” {{ he(Rihwin) }} said. {{ He(Rihwin) }} spoke softly to avoid waking Van and {{Elise}}, who could not sense the demon; it felt {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} ideas as {{ he(Rihwin) }} and {{Gerin}} perceived its.
“I name no {{ man(Balamung) }}-thing {{ master(Balamung) }}!” Its thought dinned in {{Gerin}}'s head. More quietly, it asked, “And how else am I deceived?”
“Why, by thinking you can do us harm, when you cannot so much as touch us,” Rihwin answered airily.
“How not?” the demon asked. {{Gerin}} was tempted to do the same. They had no protection against it, as it surely knew.
But Rihwin was not perturbed. “Consider,” {{ he(Rihwin) }} said: “To reach us, you first must traverse half the distance, not so?”
“What of it?” the demon snarled.
“Then you will travel half the remaining interval, and then half of that, and half that, and so on forever. You may come as close as you like, but reach us you never will.”
{{Gerin}} felt the demon muttering to itself as it pursued Rihwin’s chain of logic. It did not seem very intelligent; relying on invisibility and ferocity, it had rarely needed much in the way of wits. At last it said, “You are wrong, {{ man(Rihwin) }}-thing, and my showing you this will be your death.” Terrifyingly quick, it was twice as close as before. It halted for a moment. “Do you see?”
It halved the gap again, paused to show itself—and {{Gerin}} drove {{ hisd(Gerin) }} arrow cleanly through its central eye.
It screamed like a human broken on the rack and was gone, fleeing back to whatever plane {{Balamung}} had summoned it from. {{Gerin}} thought that agony-filled cry had to wake everything for miles, but only {{ he(Gerin) }} and Rihwin seemed to hear it. Van and {{Elise}} slept on, and all was unchanged out in the darkness. No, not quite—the ghosts returned, their murmurs now far less fear-filled than before.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} picked up the denuded aoratos bush. {{ He(Gerin) }} hefted it thoughtfully. “Thank the gods for this little plant,” {{ he(Gerin) }} said to Rihwin. “Without it, we’d’ve been nothing but appetizers for that devil.”
“At the moment I am still too terrified to move, let alone think about anything so abstract as giving thanks. You have an unpleasant and powerful enemy, my {{ fellow(Gerin) }} Fox.”
“I’ve already told you that. Didn’t you believe me before? As for fear, you handled yourself better than I did—I thought we were done for till you stalled the demon.”
Rihwin shrugged. “That paradox always did intrigue me. I first heard a variation of it posed at the Collegium, purportedly to demonstrate that a longtooth could never catch its prey, even were the victim five times slower than it.”
“It’s logically perfect, but it can’t be true. Where’s the flaw?”
“I haven’t the faintest idea, nor did my instructor. Your elucidation with the bow seemed as elegant as any.”
{{Gerin}} tried to sleep. {{ He(Gerin) }} was too keyed up to find rest quickly. {{ He(Gerin) }} was still awake when Rihwin passed the watch to Van, and listened to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend’s sulfurous oaths at not having been waked to help fight the demon. Van was still grumbling complaints into {{ hisd(Van) }} {{ beard(Van) }} as {{ hisd(Van) }} comrades at last gave in to slumber.
The next morning, {{Gerin}} let {{Elise}} drive for a while and tried to get more sleep in the back of the wagon. {{ He(Gerin) }} knew Van had managed the trick on the way south. Now {{ he(Gerin) }} wondered how. Every pothole was magnified tenfold when felt all along {{ hisd(Gerin) }} body, and rumbling wheels and creaking axles did nothing to help {{ hisd(Gerin) }} repose. Red-eyed and defeated, {{ he(Gerin) }} came forward to take the reins again.
Traffic was light, for which {{ he(Gerin) }} gave thanks. {{ He(Gerin) }} wished Van had been able to buy a pair of Shanda horses instead of just the one. The shaggy little animal pulled magnificently. It seemed never to tire.
Its harnessmate the gray gelding was willing enough, but lacked the steppe beast’s endurance. It exhaustedly hung its head at every rest stop. {{Gerin}} was afraid its wind would break if {{ he(Gerin) }} pushed it much harder.
From the chariot Rihwin was sharing with {{ him(Van) }}, Van pointed up the road at an approaching traveler and said, “Someone’s coming in one awful hurry.”
“Probably another whorespawn of a courier,” {{Gerin}} said. {{ He(Gerin) }} reached for {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bow nonetheless.
A courier it was, whipping {{ hisd(courier) }} horses as if all the fiends of all the hells were after {{ him(courier) }}. The beasts’ scarlet, flaring nostrils and lathered sides said they had been used so for some time. “Way! Clear the way!” the courier shouted as {{ he(courier) }} thundered past.
{{ He(courier }} was gone in the blink of an eye, but not before {{Gerin}} saw the long Trokmê arrow lodged in the crown of {{ hisd(courier) }} broad-brimmed hat. North of the Kirs, the blow had fallen.
Rihwin stared blankly at the dismayed looks {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} friends wore; like {{Gerin}}, {{Elise}} and Van had recognized that arrow for what it was. {{Elise}} hid {{ herd(Elise) }} face in {{ herd(Elise) }} hands and wept. When the {{ baron(Gerin) }} put an arm around {{ her(Elise) }}, {{ he(Gerin) }} almost steered the wagon into Rihwin’s chariot.
“Careful, captain,” Van said.
{{Gerin}}'s laugh was shaky. “Here I am trying to make {{Elise}} feel better, and look at me.”
“Will someone please tell me what the trouble is?” Rihwin asked plaintively.
{{Gerin}} did, in a couple of curt sentences. Despite the gray gelding’s exhaustion, {{ he(Gerin) }} urged more speed from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} horses.
“That’s good thinking,” Van called. “You can bet there’s a mob a few hours or a day behind that courier, all of them hightailing it south as fast as they can go. Best make haste while the road’s still clear.”
“A pox! I hadn’t even thought of that.” {{Gerin}} added another worry to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} list. {{ He(Gerin) }} tried to comfort {{Elise}}, who was still sobbing beside {{ him(Gerin) }}.
{{ She(Elise) }} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} arm away. “I wish I had never left—I should be with my {{ father(Ricolf) }}.” {{ She(Elise) }} cried even harder.
“I know,” {{ he(Gerin) }} said quietly. “But no one can change what you did, not god or man. All we can do now is wait to see how things are north of the Kirs and not borrow trouble till we know.” Wonderful, {{ he(Gerin) }} told {{ himself(Gerin) }}, you talk as if you thought you really could do it—and if your own guts knot any tighter, you can use them for lute strings.
Despite {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own doubts, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} words seemed to reach {{Elise}}. {{ She(Elise) }} raised {{ herd(Elise) }} tear-streaked face, trying without much success to smile. As the hours passed and the Kirs loomed ever taller on the horizon, a spurious calm came to the northbound travelers. They talked of life in the capital, legends from Kizzuwatna, sword-fish-fishing on the Bay of Parvela south of Sithonia—anything except the Trokmoi and what was happening on the far side of the mountains.
As Van had guessed, they soon began meeting refugees fleeing the Trokmê invasion. The first one they saw brought a sardonic smile to {{Gerin}}'s face: there stood {{Carus}} Beo’s {{ son(Carus) }}, tall in {{ hisd(Carus) }} chariot. {{ He(Carus) }} used {{ hisd(Carus) }} whip with more vigor than the {{ baron(Gerin) }} thought {{ he(Carus) }} still had. {{ He(Carus) }} shot passed {{Gerin}}'s party without recognizing them.
The Marchwarden of the North was but the precursor of a steadily swelling stream of fugitives, many with better reasons to flee than {{ his(Carus) }}. The warriors who appeared had the look of defeated troops: they straggled south in small, dejected parties, and many were wounded. Now and again {{Gerin}} saw a minor noble among them, sometimes leading a family and a small party of retainers, more often alone, haggard, and afraid.
The Fox kept hoping to find someone{{ he(Gerin) }} knew, so {{ he(Gerin) }} could stop him and grill him at length. For two days {{ he(Gerin) }} was disappointed. On the third, {{ he(Gerin) }} spied a merchant who had been to Fox Keep two or three times, a {{ man(Merric) }} called Merric Fork{{ beard(Merric) }}. The trader was still leading a string of donkeys, but their packsaddles were all empty. {{Gerin}} looked in vain for the two youths who had accompanied Merric in times past. When Merric heard the {{ baron(Gerin) }} call {{ hisd(Merric) }} name, {{ he(Merric) }} pulled off the road to share what word {{ he(Merric) }} had. {{ He(Merric) }} took a skin of wine. {{ Hisd(Merric) }} hands shook as {{ he(Merric) }} raised it to {{ hisd(Merric) }} lips. {{ He(Merric) }} had only a few more years on {{ him(Merric) }} than did {{Gerin}}, but looked to have added another ten in the past few days: {{ hisd(Merric) }} thin face, which {{Gerin}} remembered as full of quiet humor, was gray and drawn, {{ hisd(Merric) }} eyes haunted.
“I can’t tell you as much as I’d like, Fox,” {{ he(Merric) }} said, running fingers through thinning sandy hair. “Six days ago, I was on the road between Drotar’s holding and Clain the Fluteplayer’s—a good bit southwest of your keep, I guess that is—when I saw smoke ahead. It was the plague-taken woodsrunners, burning out a peasant village and acting as if not a soul in the world could stop them. I turned around and headed south—and ran into an ambush.” {{ He(Merric) }} bit {{ hisd(Merric) }} lip. “That’s when I lost my nephews. They died cleanly—I think.”
{{Gerin}} tried to express {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sympathy, but Merric brushed it aside. “It’s done, it’s done,” {{ he(Merric) }} said tiredly. {{ He(Merric) }} took another pull at the wineskin, went on, “I will say you’re the last person I ever expected to see south of the mountains.”
“I was looking for help against the Trokmoi, though I didn’t find much.”
“Even if you had, it would do you little good.”
“I came through the pass hours ago. Even then, officers and soldiers were rushing about, making ready to seal it off. What use would your aid be, trapped on this side of the Kirs?” {{Gerin}} stared at {{ him(Merric) }}, aghast. “Hours ago, you say?”
“Aye.”
“Then I have no time to waste bandying words with you, I fear. The gods keep you safe, Merric, and may we meet again in happier times.” The {{ baron(Gerin) }} twitched the reins and got {{ hisd(Gerin) }} wagon into motion. Van and Rihwin followed close behind in the northerner’s chariot.
Merric watched them speed north. “I don’t think I’m the one who needs the gods for my safety,” {{ he(Merric) }} muttered to {{ himself(Merric) }}.
Now {{Gerin}} could show the gray gelding no pity. Once north of the Kirs, {{ he(Gerin) }} might be able to replace it, but unless {{ he(Gerin) }} forced an all-out effort from it now, all such problems would cease to matter.
The rich southern countryside flashed by in a blur. To the north, the Kirs grew ever taller. Their crowns of snow were smaller than they had been twenty days before. High summer was drawing near.
The stream of fugitives continued to thicken, clogging the road and stretching the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s nerves tighter. Yet had that stream failed, all {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hope would have vanished with it, for {{ he(Gerin) }} would have known the pass was sealed.
{{ He(Gerin) }} raced through the grimy town of Fibis, past its crucifixes, and into the foothills, now cursing desperately at every slight delay. The gray began to fail. Its nostril flared to suck in great gulps of air and its sides heaved with the effort it was making, but it plainly could not keep up the killing pace much longer. {{Gerin}} felt its anguish as keenly as if it were {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own. Strange, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought, how in the end all {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hopes rode not on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own wit or brawn, but on the stamina of a suffering beast.
Much too slowly, the pass drew near. Another party of refugees appeared ahead, blocking the roadway and forcing the Fox to the verge. No, these were not refugees—they were the garrison troops who had manned the pass. They marched south in good order, spears neatly shouldered. If they were pulling out, the pass would be closed very soon. Even curses failed {{Gerin}}—had {{ he(Gerin) }} come so far to miss by so little?
At last the gap came into sight. The {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s heart descended from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} throat when {{ he(Gerin) }} saw it was still unblocked. But at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} approach an officer stepped into the road, backed by a double squad of archers. The officer stepped forward with a salute, introduced {{ himself(Usgild) }} as {{Usgild}} {{ son(Usgild) }} of Annar. “I am most sorry, good folk. No travel is permitted beyond this point. We are but minutes from ending contact with the north, as it is under strong barbarian attack.”
“I know—that’s why I’m here.” {{Gerin}} quickly outlined {{ hisd(Gerin) }} need.
Having heard {{ him(Gerin) }} out, {{Usgild}} shook {{ hisd(Usgild) }} head. “I cannot take the responsibility for delaying a measure vital to the safety of my Empire.” As if to underscore {{ hisd(Usgild) }} words, {{ hisd(Usgild) }} archers nocked arrows.
“Can nothing persuade you?” {{Gerin}} asked, hearing the finality in {{Usgild}}’s voice. Perhaps, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought frantically, I can bribe {{ him(Usgild) }}. But {{ he(Gerin) }} knew that had to be futile. {{Usgild}} seemed honest. Even if {{ he(Usgild) }} wasn’t, {{Gerin}} did not have enough money to buy {{ him(Usgild) }}.
Nonetheless, {{ he(Gerin) }} rummaged through {{ hisd(Gerin) }} pockets—and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fingers closed on the tiny bronze Imperial Hand the agent {{Tevis}} had left behind in Grizzard’s tavern. {{ He(Gerin) }} drew it forth and displayed it on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} upturned palm. “Can nothing persuade you?” {{ he(Gerin) }} repeated: “Not even this?”
{{ He(Gerin) }} was afraid {{Usgild}} would doubt {{ hisd(Gerin) }} right to the token, but the officer sprang to attention at the sight of the most potent official talisman the Empire knew. “My {{ lord(Gerin) }}, I had no idea—”
“Never mind all that,” {{Gerin}} said, determined to give {{ him(Usgild) }} no chance to wonder. “Send someone at once to hold things up until we are through.”
“Hanno!” the officer bawled. One of {{ hisd(Usgild) }} archers raced for a chariot.
{{Gerin}} decided more, not less, effrontery would make {{ him(Gerin) }} seem genuine. “My supplies are a bit low. I could use some field rations, and also”—he held {{ hisd(Gerin) }} breath—“a fresh horse to replace this poor creature.”
{{Usgild}} was beyond questions. “At once.” Under {{ hisd(Usgild) }} efficient direction, {{ hisd(Usgild) }} troops met {{Gerin}}'s needs. A sturdy bay stallion replaced the gelding, which barely had the strength to be led away. Soldiers stowed square loaves of journeybread, salt beef, smoked sausages, and lumps of pale, hard cheese in the back of the wagon. They and their commander eyed the Fox with almost servile respect, doing {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bidding as though they thought their lives were hanging in the balance. They probably did, {{Gerin}} thought sourly—an Imperial Hand was no one to trifle with.
{{ He(Gerin) }} wondered why {{Tevis}} had seen fit to give {{ him(Gerin) }} the emblem of {{ hisd(Tevis) }} office. Could a Hand have realized the nobles, in their way, served the {{Emperor}} too? It was hard to credit a southern citizen with such breadth of vision, but then {{Tevis}}, whatever else {{ he(Tevis) }} had been, was no ordinary southerner.
{{Usgild}} broke into {{Gerin}}'s thoughts. “My {{ lord(Gerin) }}, may I ask your mission in the north?”
“I intend to seek out and slay the {{ wizard(Balamung) }} who controls the Trokmoi.” For the first time {{Gerin}} spoke simple truth, and for the first time {{Usgild}} looked unbelieving. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} hardly blamed {{ him(Usgild) }}, as {{ he(Gerin) }} {{ himself(Gerin) }} had no idea how to put an end to {{Balamung}}.
The soldier Hanno returned. Flicking a salute to {{Gerin}}, {{ he(Usgild) }} said, “Imperial Hand or no, {{ sirm(Gerin) }}, if I were you I’d hustle down the pass. You’ve got some wizards mighty peeved at you. They were about halfway through their spells when I told them to hold up, and they’re not what you’d call pleased about having to wait and start over.”
A party like {{Usgild}}’s must have been covering the northern end of the pass. The gap through the Kirs, so congested and noisy when {{Gerin}} had come south, was achingly empty and silent. The Empire’s fortresses stared, empty-eyed, at wagon and chariot moving lonesomely where hundreds of soldiers, beasts, and wains usually passed.
Half a dozen sorcerers paced the battlements of their sparkling, glassy towers. They too glowered down on the {{ baron(Gerin) }} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} comrades. Though they were too high and too far for {{ him(Gerin) }} to read their faces, the very snap of their robes in the breeze bespoke annoyance.
As soon as {{ he(Gerin) }} was past, the mages began their spells anew, moving in sharp, precisely defined patterns and chanting antiphonally. Their voices, thin and high in the vast quiet, followed {{Gerin}} a long way down the pass.
“I know that spell,” Rihwin said, “but to think of using it on such a scale.…” {{ Hisd(Rihwin) }} voice trailed away. {{ He(Rihwin) }} urged {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} dapples out in front of the wagon.
The commander of the pass had been no fool: to stop southbound traffic {{ he(Usgild) }} had posted at the gap’s northern outlet not a token force of archers but a solid company of spearmen and charioteers. They were needed. The road stretching north was full of fugitives, shouting, begging, threatening, gesticulating, but leaderless and not quite daring to rush the orderly ranks of gleaming spearheads standing between themselves and the southland. The din was dreadful.
Or so {{Gerin}} thought for a moment. Then the earth shook beneath the wagon. The sub-bass roar of endless tons of cascading stone left {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ears stunned and ringing. A dust-filled blast of wind shrieked out of the pass behind {{ him(Gerin) }}. It caught a couple of birds and sent them tumbling through the air. Guards and refugees cried out in terror, but no sound from a merely human throat could pierce the avalanche.
“Looks like I’m home for good,” {{Gerin}} said. No one could hear {{ him(Gerin) }} either, but what did that matter? The fact itself seemed clear enough.
<h2>X</h2>
As inconspicuously as {{ he(Gerin) }} could, {{Gerin}} made {{ hisd(Gerin) }} way through the shaken solidery. No one tried to stop {{ him(Gerin) }}. If any of the imperial troops had, {{ he(Gerin) }} would have shown them the Hand. {{ He(Gerin) }} was glad {{ he(Gerin) }} did not have to. {{ He(Gerin) }} did not want to find out how they would react to the symbol of a regime which had just marooned them on the wrong side of the mountains.
Those who had fled their homes and lands in the face of the Trokmê onslaught now parted before {{Gerin}}, stepping aside like wolves in the presence of a longtooth. Anyone going north of their own free will had to be of superior stuff, not to be hindered by the likes of them.
Rihwin let the {{ baron(Gerin) }} catch up to {{ him(Rihwin) }}, then said, “You will surely need a fighting tail later. Why not start collecting it now?”
{{Gerin}} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. “These are the ones who ran first and fastest. I might be able to shame some into coming with me, but they’d likely disappear again at the first sign of a red hair.”
“Right you are, captain,” Van said. “Later we’ll run into some who got honestly beat: bushwhacked like poor Merric, or just too many woodsrunners and not enough of them. That bunch will be aching for revenge, or a second chance, or what have you. They’ll be the ones we take along.”
“The two of you make good sense,” Riwhin said, adding thoughtfully, “There’s more to this business than meets the eye.”
They rolled through Cassat not long before nightfall, fighting heavy southbound traffic all the way. The town was nearly deserted. Most of its soldiers and the folk who catered to them must have fled with Carus Beo’s {{ son(Carus) }}. Looters prowled through abandoned shops and taverns, seeking valuables, drink more potent than water, or perhaps just shelter for the night.
At most times, {{Gerin}} would have been after them sword in hand. To {{ hisd(Gerin) }} way of thinking, they were worse than Trokmoi: scavengers, preying off the misfortunes of others. Now {{ he(Gerin) }} had more important concerns. {{ He(Gerin) }} drove by, wanting to put as much distance as {{ he(Gerin) }} could between the rats’ nest Cassat had become and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} camp for the night.
Only Nothos’ crescent was in the sky when the sun went down. Math was a day and a half past new and lost in the glow of sunset. Tiwaz would not rise till midnight, and ruddy Elleb less than two hours before the next sunrise.
“Strange, not to have the Kirs staring us in the face,” {{Elise}} remarked.
{{ Herd(Elise) }} three companions round the campfire nodded. To {{Gerin}}, it was not only strange but wonderful. For the past couple of days, the mountains and the sealing of the pass had loomedover {{ him(Gerin) }} like a death sentence. Now {{ he(Gerin) }} felt reprieved. Tomorrow {{ he(Gerin) }} would need to start thinking of {{Balamung}} and the Trokmoi again but, as {{ he(Gerin) }} drew in a deep breath of cool night air made flavorful by the fire’s smoke, {{ he(Gerin) }} deliberately suppressed such worries.
Some responsibility, though, had to stay with {{ him(Gerin) }}. “We need to be really careful on watch tonight,” {{ he(Gerin) }} said. “Some of the fools on the run will be more afraid of the Trokmoi than the ghosts. They’ll likely be on the move tonight. And who knows? The woods-runners may be this far south already.”
Travelers in the night there were, but no Trokmoi and no problems, at least during the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s watch. But when {{ he(Gerin) }} woke the next morning to the sound of Rihwin’s fervent cursing, {{ he(Gerin) }} knew something had gone wrong. “What now?” {{ he(Gerin) }} muttered, groping for {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sword.
“The plague-taken wine’s gone sour!” Rihwin said. “It’s no better than vinegar.”
“Great {{Dyaus}} above, from the howl you raised I thought it was {{Balamung}} come in person. Worse things have happened than sour wine, my friend.”
“So have better ones. You cannot know what torment my year at {{Ricolf}}’s was, away from the sweet grape.”
“Aye, and look at the trouble you got into, once you had it back,” Van said.
Rihwin ignored {{ him(Van) }}. “By the gods, I’d thought a year’s separation long enough, but here I am, bereft again.”
“If you must have you precious wine,” {{Gerin}} snapped, “are you not mage enough to call it back from vinegar? If not, why did I ask you to come with me?”
Rihwin refused to notice the exasperation in {{Gerin}}'s voice, but eagerly seized on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} idea. “Your wits are with you, my fellow Fox! I learned that spell—” (“Naturally,” {{Elise}} murmured, so low only {{Gerin}} heard) “and it’s easy to cast.”
As usual, the southerner was quick to fit action to thought. {{ He(Rihwin) }} rummaged through {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} gear, producing a packet of grayish powder and a minor grimoire. {{Gerin}} was relieved to see {{ him(Rihwin) }} checking the spell before {{ he(Rihwin) }} used it, but still felt a gnawing sense of unease. Things were moving too fast, and out of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} control.
Rihwin fed tinder to the nearly dead embers of the fire, coaxing them back into flame. {{ He(Rihwin) }} sprinkled a few drops of the turned wine onto the fire, chanting an invocation in Sithonian. The gray powder followed. It produced an aromatic cloud of smoke. Rihwin chanted on: “… and to thee, O great {{Mavrix}}—”
{{Gerin}}'s unease became alarm, but too late. With a whistling hiss, the summoned {{ god(Mavrix) }}, in all {{ hisd(Mavrix) }} dazzling finery, stood before Rihwin. “So!” {{Mavrix}} screeched, bouncing with wrath. “You are in league with this miscreant, and have the gall to seek my aid?” The furious deity pointed a finger at Gerin; somehow it did not seem strange that the digit should lengthen till it thumped the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s chest.
“I will never help you, {{ wizard(Rihwin) }}! Never! Never!” {{Mavrix}} shouted, dancing around the little fire in a sort of war-dance. “And you shall never have the chance to ask my aid again. Mortal wretch, now and forever-more you have forfeited your right to work sorcery, and be thankful I leave you the remainder of your pustulent life!
“Take that, ox-goad!” the {{ god(Mavrix) }} added for {{Gerin}}'s benefit. {{ He(Mavrix) }} stuck out a long pink tongue like a frog’s, made a gesture street urchins often used in the capital, and vanished.
“What was all that in aid of?” Rihwin asked, white-faced.
“I told you before, the {{ god(Mavrix) }} and I had a disagreement not long ago.”
“Disagreement forsooth! The next time you have a disagreement with a {{ god(Mavrix) }}, my dear {{Gerin}}, please let me know in advance so I can take myself elsewhere—far elsewhere.” Rihwin tried to resume {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} interrupted spell, stopped in confusion. “A pox! The pestilential godlet did it! I still know every spell I ever knew, but I can’t use them. No wine, no magic …” {{ He(Rihwin) }} seemed ready to burst into tears.
So, for the moment, was {{Gerin}}. {{ He(Gerin) }} had gone south with high hopes, and returned with—what? A suddenly useless {{ wizard(Rihwin) }} and some sour wine. No, fool, wait, {{ he(Gerin) }} told {{ himself(Gerin) }} before {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mood altogether blackened—there’s {{Elise}}, and {{ she(Elise) }}’s worth troubles a dozen times worse than these. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} gloomy side added: or {{ she(Elise) }} will be, if troubles no worse than these at all don’t kill you first.
The Elabon Way continued packed with refugees. They fled south toward a safety that no longer existed, carrying on their backs or in handcarts such pitiful belongings as they had salvaged. Pushing north against them was so slow that at last, much against {{ hisd(Gerin) }} will, {{Gerin}} decided to leave the highway and travel on back roads. Though less direct, {{ he(Gerin) }} hoped they would also be less traveled.
{{ Hisd(Gerin) }} hopes were justified most of that day. {{ He(Gerin) }} made better progress than {{ he(Gerin) }} had since {{ he(Gerin) }}’d first seen that accursed imperial courier. But as the first cool evening breezes began to blow, what must have been the whole population of two or three farming villages jammed the narrow track on which {{ he(Gerin) }} was traveling.
The peasants had their families and meager possessions in ramshackle carts driven by oxen or asses. They drove their flocks of cattle and sheep before them. When the {{ baron(Gerin) }} tried to tell them the way through the Kirs was blocked, they listened in dull incomprehension, as if {{ he(Gerin) }} were speaking some foreign tongue, and continued on their way.
The same thing happened three more times in the next two days. {{Gerin}}'s pace slowed to a crawl. Once more {{ he(Gerin) }} had the feeling the whole world was against {{ him(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} was brusque even with {{Elise}}, and so churlish toward Rihwin and Van that the outlander finally growled, “Captain, why don’t you shut up and do us all a favor?” Shame-faced, the Fox apologized.
Later that day, {{Gerin}} heard a commotion ahead, but thick woods and winding road kept its nature hidden. {{ He(Gerin) }}, Van, and Rihwin reached for their weapons. But when the path opened out into a clearing, they put them down—there would be no fighting here. Instead of Trokmoi, they had come upon yet another group of peasants taking flight and the local landowner trying to talk them out of it. Or so {{Gerin}} thought at first. A moment’s listening showed {{ him(Gerin) }} the noble{{ man(Nordric)}} had given up on that and was telling them what {{ he(Nordric) }} thought of them for going.
“You cheese-faced, goat-buggering, arse-licking whores’ get—” The noble’s command of invective was marvelous; even Van listened in wide-eyed admiration. The {{ fellow(Nordric) }}’s appearance complemented {{ hisd(Nordric) }} delivery. {{ He(Nordric) }} was a solidly made {{ man(Nordric) }} of about thirty-five; {{ he(Nordric) }} had a fierce red face with one eye covered by a leather patch, thick brows, and a tangled black {{ beard(Nordric) }}. {{ He(Nordric) }} wore a bearskin cape over broad shoulders and massive chest, and carried a brace of scabbardless swords on {{ hisd(Nordric) }} belt. “Lizard-livered, grave-robbing sodomites—”
The abuse rolled off {{ hisd(Nordric) }} tenants like water from oiled leather. They were going whether {{ he(Nordric) }} liked it or not. Despite the three troopers and two chariots {{ he(Nordric) }} had at {{ hisd(Nordric) }} back, there were at least twenty people in the exodus, each with scythe, mattock, or pitchfork close at hand. {{Gerin}} wished they would have been as ready to take up arms against the Trokmoi.
As the peasants began to move, the minor {{ baron(Nordric) }} noticed {{Gerin}}. “Who in the five hells are you?” {{ he(Nordric) }} growled. “Why aren’t you on the run like these pissweeds here?”
{{Gerin}} named {{ himself(Gerin) }} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friends. {{ He(Gerin) }} asked, “Are the woodsrunners so close, then, to send your villeins flying?”
“Close? I’ve yet to see one of the pox-ridden bandits, for all they’ve sent these dungheaded clods a-flying, aye, and most of my fighting folk too. I’ve seen partridges with more heart in ’em than they showed.” {{ He(Nordric) }} spat in utter contempt and slowly began to calm. “I’m {{Nordric}} One-Eye, in case you’re wondering—landowner hereabouts, not that I look to have much left to be owner over.”
“Friend {{Nordric}},” Rihwin said, “would it please you to fare north with us and take vengeance on the barbarians who have caused such chaos?”
{{Nordric}} lifted an eyebrow at the southerner’s phrasing, but the notion of hitting back at the Trokmoi was too tempting for {{ him(Nordric) }} to resist. “Please me? Great {{Dyaus}} above, I’d like nothing better! Those sheep-futtering, louse-bitten woodsrunning robbers—”
{{ He(Nordric) }} rumbled on for another couple of angry sentences. Then {{ he(Nordric) }} and one of {{ hisd(Nordric) }} retainers climbed aboard one chariot and the other two soldiers into the second. {{ Hisd(Nordric) }} driver, {{Gerin}} learned as they began to travel, was {{Amgath}} Andar’s {{ son(Amgath) }}; one of the last pair was Effo and the other Cleph, but the Fox was not sure which was which. Neither of them said much. Nor, for that matter, did Amgath.
That did not surprise {{Gerin}}. {{Nordric}} talked enough for four. Not only that, {{ he(Nordric) }} kept peppering {{ hisd(Nordric) }} speech, even on the most innocuous subjects, with fluent, explosive profanity.
Rihwin steered close to {{Gerin}}. “It’s as well for {{ him(Nordric) }} {{ he(Nordric) }}’s short an eye—otherwise they’d surely style {{ him(Nordric) }} {{Nordric}} Swillmouth.”
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} grinned and nodded. {{ He(Gerin) }} was still glad to have {{Nordric}} along. {{ He(Gerin) }} did not think the foul-mouthed {{ baron(Nordric) }} would shrink from a fight, or {{ hisd(Nordric) }} troops either. Facing Trokmoi in battle had to be less terrifying than confronting an angry {{Nordric}} afterwards.
Though armed, {{Nordric}} and {{ hisd(Nordric) }} soldiers carried few provisions. {{Gerin}} had resupplied from imperial stores at the pass, but {{ he(Gerin) }} knew what {{ he(Gerin) }} had would not feed eight people long. The food would go even faster if {{ he(Gerin) }} gathered more followers. That meant spending time hunting instead of traveling, something {{ he(Gerin) }} resented but whose necessity {{ he(Gerin) }} recognized.
More companions, though, also meant more people to stand watch. Freed from the need to break {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sleep with a watch in three, {{Gerin}} spent the early evening sitting by the fire with Rihwin. {{ He(Gerin) }} studied the southerner’s grimoires with a desperate intensity that {{ he(Gerin) }} knew was almost surely futile. Still, {{ he(Gerin) }} persisted. The vengeful {{Mavrix}} had taken Rihwin’s power to work magic, but not, it seemed, {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} ability to pass on what {{ he(Rihwin) }} knew.
“Here.” Rihwin pointed to an incantation written in the sinuous Kizzuwatnan script. “This is another spell for the destruction of one’s enemies when a bit of their spittle, hair, or nail pairings is in one’s possession.”
“How does it differ from the more usual one, the one I would have set on the fair {{Namarra}}?”
“It has the advantage of needing no elaborate preparation, but is more dangerous to the caster. Unless perfectly performed, it will fall on one’s own head rather than the intended victim’s.”
“Hmm.” The spell looked simple enough, involving only a couple of genuflections and some easy passes with the left hand. But as {{Gerin}} studied its verbal element, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} first enthusiasm faded: the Kizzuwatnan text was one long tongue-twister, full of puns, subtle allusions to gods {{ he(Gerin) }} barely knew, constantly shifting patterns of rhyme and rhythm. {{ He(Gerin) }} almost passed at once to the next charm. Then, stung by the challenge and artistry of the ancient versicle, {{ he(Gerin) }} stopped and read it again and again, until it was fairly well lodged in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind.
“I have it,” {{ he(Gerin) }} said at last, adding, “I think. What’s next?”
“Here is one I’ve always found useful. It keeps horses’ hooves sound and strong, and helps prevent all sorts of lameness.”
“Yes, I can see where that would be a good thing to know. Ah, good, it’s in Sithonian, too. Let me have a closer look—” And soon the veterinary magic was also stored in the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s capacious memory.
The next day dawned luminously clear. The sun leaped into a sky of almost southern clarity and brilliance. The fine weather pleased {{Gerin}} less than it might have under other circumstances. In such heat, armor became an itchy, sweaty torment, but trouble was too close to chance removing it.
Thus the {{ baron(Gerin) }}, longing for relief from the sweltering day, was glad to hear the rush of river water ahead. But almost at the same instant, {{ he(Gerin) }} became aware of other sounds rising above the stream’s plashing: the clash of bronze on bronze, the deep battle cries of Elabonian fighters, and the higher, wilder yells of the Trokmoi.
Van was driving Rihwin’s chariot. When {{ he(Van) }} caught the noise of combat, {{ hisd(Van) }} head jerked up like that of a dog suddenly taking a scent. “A fight!” {{ he(Van) }} shouted, {{ hisd(Van) }} voice pure glee. “The gods beshrew me, a fight!”
{{ He(Van) }} sent the light car bounding forward with such a rush that {{ he(Van) }} almost pitched the startled Rihwin into the roadway. {{Nordric}} and {{ hisd(Nordric) }} driver were right behind, the stocky {{ baron(Nordric) }} swearing sulfurously. On {{ his(Nordric) }} heels were {{ hisd(Nordric) }} soldiers, leaving {{Gerin}} to bring up the rear.
The Fox cursed as fervently as {{Nordric}}, but for a different reason. The last thing {{ he(Gerin) }} wanted was to expose {{Elise}} to the risks of war, but {{ he(Gerin) }} had no choice. “For {{Dyaus}}’ sake, stay in the wagon and don’t draw attention to yourself.” {{ He(Gerin) }} handed {{ her(Elise) }} {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bow and quiver. “Use them only if you have to.”
Black willows grew along the riverbank. Under their low spreading branches a grim drama was under way, with seven southerners battling twice as many Trokmoi. The Elabonians had accounted for four woods-runners, but three of their own number were down and the survivors desperately fighting back to back at the water’s edge when unexpected rescue arrived.
The Trokmoi shouted in dismay as {{Gerin}}'s band leaped from chariots and wagons and loosed murder among them. Van was a thunderstorm, {{Gerin}} and Rihwin a pair of deadly snakes, striking and flickering away before being struck in return. {{Nordric}}’s people fought with dour competence, but the petty {{ baron(Nordric) }} {{ himself(Nordric) }} brought the worst terror to the barbarians.
At last come to grips with the foes who had turned {{ hisd(Nordric) }} life upside down, {{ he(Nordric) }} went berserker-mad, {{ hisd(Nordric) }} ruddy features darkening to purple, incoherent cries of raw rage roaring from {{ hisd(Nordric) }} throat, spittle flecking {{ hisd(Nordric) }} {{ beard(Nordric) }} with white. Swinging a sword in each meaty hand, {{ he(Nordric) }} rampaged through the Trokmoi, oblivious to {{ hisd(Nordric) }} own safety as long as {{ he(Nordric) }} felt flesh cleave and bones shatter beneath {{ hisd(Nordric) }} hammerstrokes. The Trokmoi broke and ran after half of them had fallen. All but one were cut down from behind by the vengeful Elabonians. An arrow from the wagon brought down the last of them, who had outdistanced {{ hisd(Nordric) }} pursuers—{{Elise}} once more proving {{ herd(Elise) }} worth.
The onslaught was so sudden and fierce that Nordric’s follower Cleph was the only Elabonian badly hurt. {{ He(Amgath) }} had a great gash in {{ hisd(Amgath) }} thigh. {{Gerin}} washed it with wine and styptics and bound it up, but the bleeding would not stop. Cleph was pale and clammy, and seemed partly out of {{ hisd(Amgath) }} wits.
“You’re going to have to tie off {{ hisd(Amgath) }} leg,” Van said.
“I hate to,” {{Gerin}} answered. “If I leave the tie on for more than a few hours the leg may go gangrenous, and if I take it off {{ he(Amgath) }}’ll probably start bleeding again.”
“Look at {{ him(Amgath) }}, though. {{ He(Amgath) }}’ll damn well bleed out on you right now if you don’t do something in a hurry,” Van said. Shaking {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head, {{Gerin}} applied the tourniquet. The flow of blood slowed to a trickle, but Cleph remained semi-conscious, muttering curses under {{ hisd(Amgath) }} breath against demons only {{ he(Amgath) }} could see.
{{Nordric}}’s battle-demon, on the other hand, deserted {{ him(Nordric) }} after the fight was done. A {{ man(Nordric) }} in a daze, {{ he(Nordric) }} wandered across the small field of combat, staring at the results of {{ hisd(Nordric) }} own butchery. “Dip me in dung and fry me for a chicken,” {{ he(Nordric) }} grunted, apparently not much believing what {{ he(Nordric) }} saw.
“Friend {{Nordric}}, must your every phrase have an oath in it?” Rihwin asked.
“That’s not so—” {{Nordric}} began, but {{ hisd(Nordric) }} driver {{Amgath}} interrupted {{ him(Nordric) }}.
“I fear it is, my {{ lord(Nordric) }},” {{ he(Amgath) }} said. “Remember what happened when Holgar the Raven bet you a goldpiece you couldn’t go a day without saying something vile? ‘You spawn of a whore, you’re on!’ you said, and forfeited on the spot.”
The four footsoldiers {{Gerin}} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} comrades had saved were glad to take service with {{ him(Gerin) }}. Two of them had lost family to the Trokmoi. They were all burning to retaliate. “The worst thing about dying here,” said one, “would have been knowing we’d only taken a woodsrunner apiece with us.”
{{Elise}} found {{ herself(Elise) }} less troubled over the Trokmê {{ she(Elise) }}’d slain than {{ she(Elise) }} had been at Ikos, which in turn troubled {{ her(Elise) }}. That evening {{ she(Elise) }} said to {{Gerin}}, “I don’t understand it. {{ He(Gerin) }} was only running away, and the driver back at the {{Sibyl}}’s shrine was trying to kill us, but the first death left me sick for days, and now I feel almost nothing: only that I did what I had to do.”
“Which is nothing less than true,” the Fox said, though {{ he(Gerin) }} knew it did not help much.
{{ He(Gerin) }} stood a late watch, and a strange one in that no moons were in the sky: Tiwaz was new that night, Elleb a thin crescent, golden Math a fatter one, and pale, slow-moving Nothos just past first quarter. By an hour past midnight it was cool, quiet, and amazingly dark. Countless dim stars the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had never seen before powdered the sky with silver, their light for once not drowned by the moons.
Cleph died early the next day. {{ He(Amgath) }} had never really come to {{ himself(Amgath) }} after the shock of the wound, and whenever the tourniquet was loosened it began to bleed again. They hastily buried {{ him(Amgath) }} and pressed on.
Two fighters joined them that day, half a dozen more on the next, footsoldiers all. Of necessity, {{Gerin}} was reduced to a pace a walking person could keep. {{ He(Gerin) }} wondered it the added numbers were worth the delay, and considered moving ahead with chariots alone. Van and {{Nordric}} were all for it. Rihwin advised caution. Events soon proved {{ him(Gerin) }} right.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s fighting tail was emerging from forest into cleared fields when a wild shout from ahead made them all grab for weapons. Just out of bowshot waited a force of Trokmoi of nearly the same makeup as their own: four chariots and a double handful of retainers afoot. About half the northerners wore plundered Elabonian armor. The others were in their native tunics and trousers, except for one tall, gaunt barbarian who was naked but for shield and weapons.
{{Gerin}} heard a growl go up behind {{ him(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} knew the soldiers at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} back were wild to hurl themselves against the Trokmoi. But {{ he(Gerin) }} did not want to fight at this moment, against this foe. The little armies were too evenly matched. Even if {{ he(Gerin) }} won the battle, {{ he(Gerin) }} would be defenseless against the next band of woods-runners {{ he(Gerin) }} happened across.
The Trokmê seemed to have similar thoughts, which puzzled the {{ baron(Gerin) }}. Most northerners fought first and questioned later. {{ He(Gerin) }} watched, bemused, as the chief winded a long, straight horn. {{ He(Gerin) }} was no trumpeter, but {{Gerin}} recognized the call {{ he(Gerin) }} had blown: parley.
{{ He(Gerin) }} waved an agreement, got down from the wagon, and walked alone into the field. {{ He(Gerin) }} ignored the scandalized murmurs of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} followers. Those stopped abruptly when Van announced, “The next one of you who carps will be carp stew.” {{ Hisd(Van) }} huge right fist, fingers tight round the sweat-stained leather grip of {{ hisd(Van) }} mace, was a persuasive argument.
The northerner met {{Gerin}} halfway between theirmen, empty hands outstretched before {{ him(Dagdogma) }}. Plump for a woodsrunner but cat-courteous, the Trokmê bowed low and said, “I am {{Dagdogma}} the {{ son(Dagdogma) }} of Iucharba, who was the {{ son(Dagdogma) }} of Amergin the great cattle-thief, who was the {{ son(Dagdogma) }} of Laeg the smith, who was …” {{Gerin}} composed {{ himself(Gerin) }} to wait out the genealogy, which, if it was like most others, would go back ten or twelve generations to a {{ god(Dagdogma) }}.
Sure enough, Dagdogma finished, “… who was the {{ son(Dagdogma) }} of great Fomor {{ himself(Dagdogma) }}.” {{ He(Dagdogma) }} waited in turn.
{{Gerin}} did not think it wise to reveal {{ hisd(Gerin) }} true name to the barbarian. “Call me {{Tevis}},” {{ he(Gerin) }} said, picking the first name {{ he(Gerin) }} thought of. Like Dagdogma, {{ he(Gerin) }} spoke in Elabonian.
“The {{ son(Gerin) }} of—?” Dagdogma prompted politely.
“Nobody, I fear.”
“Ah well, a {{ man(Gerin) }}’s a {{ man(Gerin) }} for all {{ he(Gerin) }}’s a bastard, and a fine crew you have with you. Not that we couldn’t deal with them, but I’m thinking ’twould be a shame and a waste of my lads and yours both to be fighting the now.”
{{Gerin}} studied Dagdogma, suspecting a trick. Things {{ he(Gerin) }} had not noticed at first began to register: the Elabonian’s rings the Trokmê had jammed onto {{ hisd(Dagdogma) }} little fingers, the gleaming soft leather boots {{ he(Dagdogma) }} wore instead of the woodsrunners’ usual rawhide, the booty piled high in {{ hisd(Dagdogma) }} chariots. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} suddenly understood. This was no northern wolf, just a jackal out to scavenge what {{ he(Dagdogma) }} could with as little effort as possible.
The Fox was filled with relief and contempt at the same time. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} talk with Dagdogma went quickly and well since, each for {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own reasons, neither of them had any stomach for fighting. The Trokmê trotted back to {{ hisd(Dagdogma) }} people. {{ He(Dagdogma) }} moved them off along a forest track running west, clearing the way north for {{Gerin}} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} troop.
But {{Gerin}}'s own warriors were unhappy {{ he(Gerin) }} had talked {{ hisd(Gerin) }} way past the Trokmoi instead of hewing through them. “I came in with you to kill the whoresons, not pat ’em on the fanny as they go by,” said one of the soldiers who had joined just that day. “If you’re going to fight your fool war like that, count me out. I’d sooner do it right.”
{{ He(Gerin) }} stamped away, followed by four more footsoldiers of like spirit. Van looked questioningly at {{Gerin}}, asking with {{ hisd(Van) }} eyes whether to bring them back by force. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. {{ He(Gerin) }} had no use for unwilling followers.
In turn, {{ he(Gerin) }} eyed {{Nordric}} curiously; {{ he(Gerin) }}’d expected the hot-tempered lordlet to leave {{ him(Gerin) }} the moment {{ he(Gerin) }} ducked a confrontation. {{Nordric}} spat. {{ He(Gerin) }} said. “That was just a pig in a red {{ mustache(Dagdogma) }}, and scarce worth the slaughter. There’ll be real fighting soon enough—I think you draw bloodspilling like honey draws flies.”
Just what I need, {{Gerin}} thought, but {{ he(Gerin) }} had the uneasy feeling {{Nordric}} was right.
As {{ he(Gerin) }} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} band moved north the next day, signs of the devastation the Trokmoi were working became more frequent: corpses by the roadside (some Elabonian warriors, some woodsrunners, and all too many serfs hacked down for the sport of it), empty peasant villages (some abandoned; others gutted, smoking ruins), livestock wantonly slaughtered and now rotting in the sun, fields of wheat and oats trampled into ruin or torched, and a good many keeps overthrown. A couple of castles now flew northern banners. Some of the Trokmoi, at least, had come to stay.
Their raiding parties were everywhere—bands of half a dozen or so, under no real leadership, out more for the joy of fighting and the hope of booty than for {{Balamung}} or the conquest of the world. The Trokmoi seemed surprised to see a sizable party of Elabonians under arms. They gave them a wide berth.
The farther north {{Gerin}} went, the fewer refugees {{ he(Gerin) }} came across. Most of those who had fled had already fallen to the barbarians, perished on the road, or made their way south. The few fugitives {{ he(Gerin) }} did encounter could tell {{ him(Gerin) }} little. They had been skulking in the woods for days now. None wanted to join {{ him(Gerin) }}.
{{ Hisd(Gerin) }} homeland’s agony brought torment to the Fox. How could {{ he(Gerin) }} alleviate it even if {{ he(Gerin) }} beat {{Balamung}}? “Twenty years of peace will hardly repair this,” {{ he(Gerin) }} said bitterly that night, “and when has the border ever known twenty years of peace?”
Only the moons, almost evenly spaced across the sky, were above all strife. Nothos had been nearly due southeast at sunset, Math a day past first quarter, Elleb just at it. Rushing toward {{ hisd(Tiwaz) }} three slower siblings, Tiwaz was now a fat waxing crescent. As twilight deepened, the fourfold shadows they cast spread fan-wise from foot soldiers, chariots, and trees. The ghosts began their senseless night whispers.
Although {{Gerin}}'s troop was still traveling by back roads, {{Elise}} began to recognize the cast of the land the next morning. Pointing to a keep crowning a hillock ahead, {{ she(Elise) }} said, “That holding belongs to {{Tibald}} Drinkwater, one of my {{ father(Ricolf) }}’s vassals. We must be less than a day from home!”
The Fox had not dared hope {{ he(Gerin) }} could come this far unscathed. An unfamiliar confidence began to grow in {{ him(Gerin) }}. It was rudely dashed when {{ he(Gerin) }} drew closer to {{Tibald}}’s keep and discovered it had been abandoned and looted and its palisade torn down.
A little later, the path they were following merged with the Elabon Way. Without hesitation, {{Gerin}} led {{ hisd(Gerin) }} band onto the highway. They sped north for the castle of {{Ricolf}} the Red. Van left Rihwin’s chariot and joined the Fox. {{ He(Van) }} took over the driving; {{Elise}}, despite {{ herd(Elise) }} protests, was relegated to the rear of the wagon. If they traveled openly through country held by their foes, they had to do so in battle order; one of the new footsoldiers took Van’s place with Rihwin.
As Van tested the edge of one of {{ hisd(Van) }} chakrams with a callused forefinger, {{ he(Van) }} said softly, “Captain, if {{Ricolf}}’s holding has fallen, you’ll look a right fool coming up on it in the open like this.”
“If {{Ricolf}}’s holding has fallen, I’ll be in too much trouble to care how I look.”
The last time {{Gerin}} traveled this stretch of road, it had been too dark and {{ he(Gerin) }} was going too fast to pay much attention to landmarks. By now, though, {{Elise}} was on land {{ she(Elise) }} had known since birth. “As soon as we round this next bend, we’ll be able to see the keep,” {{ she(Elise) }} said.
“Aye, there it is,” Van said a moment later, “and the red banner still flying, too. But what’s all that folderol around the moat—tents and things?” {{ He(Van) }} drew up the wagon. {{Gerin}} waved the rest of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} little force to a halt.
“It’s a {{Dyaus}}-accursed siege camp, that’s what it is,” the {{ baron(Gerin) }} said. “Who would have thought it from the Trokmoi? Freeze, blast, and damn {{Balamung}}! Still, though, I think we may be able to give them a surprise.” {{ He(Gerin) }} climbed down from the wagon and talked briefly with {{ hisd(Gerin) }} followers. They nodded and readied themselves.
The Trokmoi had set up their perimeter just out of bowshot from the ramparts of {{Ricolf}}’s castle, intending to starve it into submission. A scallop in the outer edge of the moat showed where they had tried to hurry matters by filling it and storming the walls. That, plainly, had failed.
No one raised an alarm as {{Gerin}} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fighters drew close. As the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had noticed, the woodsrunners did not seem to think an armed party could belong to anyone but themselves. But sooner than the Fox hoped, a sharp-eyed Trokmê raised a shout: “Esus, Taranis, and Teutates! The southrons it is!”
Quick as {{ he(Van) }} was, {{ he(Van) }} was too late. {{Gerin}}'s band was already rushing forward, foot and chariotry alike. A flight of fire arrows sent trails of smoke across the sky. The arrows landed on the woolen fabric of the Trokmê tents. A second flight followed the first; a couple of archers had time for a third release before they had to reach for spear and sword to defend themselves from the barbarians, who came rushing from the siege line to meet this new threat.
The Trokmoi hurled themselves into battle with their usual ferocity. These were no fainthearts like {{Dagdogma}} and {{ hisd(Dagdogma) }} crew, but {{Gerin}}'s attack cast them into confusion. And after the first few moments, they had no leader to direct their courage. Van took care of that. {{ He(Van) }} sent a chakram spinning into the throat of a gilded-helmed noble. It cut {{ him(Dagdogma) }} down in the midst of a shouted order.
“What fine things chakrams are!” Van told {{Gerin}} as {{ he(Van) }} readied another knife-edged quoit. “I can cast them and drive at the same time.” As {{ he(Van) }} had in the capital, {{ he(Van) }} handled the wagon as if it were a chariot. The {{ baron(Gerin) }}, who had both hands free, felled two barbarians with well-placed arrows.
Battle madness seized {{Nordric}} harder now than it had by the river. Disdaining even {{ hisd(Nordric) }} sword, {{ he(Nordric) }} leaped from {{ hisd(Nordric) }} chariot, seized a Trokmê, and broke {{ him(barbarian1) }} over {{ hisd(Nordric) }} knee like a dry stick. An instant later {{ he(Nordric) }} was down {{ himself(Nordric) }}, caught in the side of the head by the flat of a northerner’s blade. Three Elabonian footsoldiers held off the Trokmoi until {{ he(Nordric) }} was on {{ hisd(Nordric) }} feet and fighting again.
Leaderless or no, the woodsrunners badly outnumbered {{Gerin}}'s group {{ He(Gerin) }} was beginning to wonder if {{ he(Gerin) }}’d bitten off more than {{ he(Gerin) }} could chew when, as {{ he(Gerin) }}’d hoped, their camp began to blaze. Many of them pulled out of the fight in dismay. They tried to fight the flames or salvage what belongings and booty they could.
Then {{Ricolf}}’s drawbridge thudded down. {{ He(Ricolf) }} and {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} fighters fell on the barbarians from the rear. {{Ricolf}} and a few of {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} followers had harnessed their chariots. Their arrows spread destruction through the northerners.
The battle was suddenly a rout. The Trokmoi fled singly and in small groups, turning to loose an occasional arrow but not daring to stand and fight. {{Ricolf}} and {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} charioteers rode a short distance in pursuit, but had no real mass of fugitives to chase. They soon reined in.
Then the soldiers from the besieged castle were all over {{Gerin}}'s troopers. They squeezed their hands, pounded their backs, and yelled congratulations and thanks. But their jubilation faded as they recognized first Rihwin and then {{Gerin}} and Van. Curiosity replaced it. That grew tenfold when {{Elise}} stuck {{ herd(Elise) }} head out of the wagon. Many shouted happily to see {{ her(Elise) }}, but as many seemed confused.
{{Ricolf}} returned from the hunt. {{ Hisd(Ricolf) }} jaw dropped when {{ he(Ricolf) }} caught sight of Rihwin, who was having a hurt arm attended to. “What are you doing here?” {{ he(Ricolf) }} growled. Rihwin flinched. {{ He(Rihwin) }} started to stammer a reply, but {{Ricolf}} paid no heed. {{ He(Ricolf) }} had just seen {{Gerin}}, Van, and {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} {{ daughter(Elise) }}.
{{Gerin}} waited in some apprehension, not sure what the older {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s reaction would be. {{Ricolf}} got down from {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} chariot, speechless and shaking {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} head. {{ He(Ricolf) }} folded {{Elise}} into {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} arms, then turned to the Fox. “I might have known trouble would lure you back, kidnapper,” {{ he(Ricolf) }} said; {{Gerin}} was relieved to hear no anger in {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} tone. “Your timely return has an explanation, I’m sure?”
“Would you hear it now?”
“This very instant. If anyone is entitled, I am.”
Having recovered some but not quite enough of {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} usual aplomb, Rihwin suggested, “Perhaps to cool {{ hisd(Gerin) }} throat after {{ hisd(Gerin) }} exertions, my fellow Fox could use a cup of wine—” {{ He(Rihwin) }} stopped abruptly. The glare {{Ricolf}} turned on {{ him(Rihwin) }} was frightening.
“Rihwin, you are a fine young {{ man(Rihwin) }} in many ways,” {{Ricolf}} said, “but if ever I hear the word ‘wine’ in your mouth again, I vow it will have my fist there for company.”
So, unmoistened, {{Gerin}} plunged into the tale. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} comrades did not let {{ him(Gerin) }} tell it unhindered, but {{ he(Gerin) }} controlled the flow of it, and it went well. {{ He(Gerin) }} saw {{Ricolf}}’s people, many of whom had given {{ him(Gerin) }} hard looks when {{ he(Gerin) }} began, coming round as {{ he(Gerin) }} spoke. When {{ he(Gerin) }} was done, {{Ricolf}} stayed silent a long time. {{ He(Ricolf) }} finally said, “Do you know, I believe you. No one would make up such an unlikely story.”
“The last person who said something like that was {{Valdabrun}},” {{Gerin}} told {{ him(Ricolf) }}.
“From what I remember of my {{ brother(Valdabrun) }}-in-law, {{ he(Valdabrun) }} has trouble believing the sun comes up each morning. {{ He(Valdabrun) }} misses a good deal of the juice in life.” A twinkle in {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} eye, {{Ricolf}} asked {{Elise}}, “Do you mean to tell me you’d rather have this devious wretch than a forthright warrior like {{Wolfar}}?”
{{ She(Elise) }} kissed the Fox by way of answer.
{{Ricolf}} turned to {{Gerin}}. “Frankly, Fox, I thought you had more sense than to get involved in a tangle like this one.”
“Frankly, so did I.”
“Hmm. A year ago I had {{Elise}}’s wedding plans firmly in hand, and now I seem to have very little to say about them. As I recall, {{Gerin}}, you said something about ‘a mind of {{ herd(Elise) }} own.’ You were right, the gods know. This, though, I say and mean: I think you will make my {{ daughter(Elise) }} a good {{ husband(Gerin) }}, but there will be no rushed wedding for fear of what the future may bring. If it should bring ill, such a wedding had better never happened. When the Trokmoi are driven away, that will be time enough.”
“I can’t quarrel with you,” {{Gerin}} said. {{ He(Gerin) }} saw disappointment cross {{Elise}}’s face, but {{Ricolf}}’s demand was only just under the circumstances.
Van said, “{{Ricolf}}, would you put a fist in my face if I asked for a mug of ale?”
“In your face?” {{Ricolf}} laughed. “You’re like the thousand-pound thrush in the riddle, who perches where {{ he(Van) }} pleases. Things are a bit tight—the damned barbarians have been sitting outside for some days. We’re a long way from being starved out, though. Come along, all of you. We’ll see what we can do.”
“You spoke of {{Wolfar}} in jest a moment ago,” {{Gerin}} said. “What happened to {{ him(Wolfar) }} after I, ah—?”
“Left suddenly? When {{ he(Wolfar) }} woke up (which wasn’t soon; you’re stronger than you think), {{ he(Wolfar) }} tried to beat down the door of my chamber and have me send all my retainers after you at once. I’d have done it, too, were it not for the note {{Elise}} left behind,” {{Ricolf}} said.
{{Elise}} looked smug. {{Gerin}} pretended not to notice.
{{Ricolf}} went on, “When I said no, things grew unpleasant. {{Wolfar}} called me an oathbreaker and worse. {{ He(Wolfar) }} said {{ he(Wolfar) }}’d pull my castle down around my ears for me. After that, I told {{ him(Wolfar) }} {{ he(Wolfar) }} could take {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} carcass away while {{ he(Wolfar) }} still had ears of {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} own. I see what you meant about {{ him(Wolfar) }}, Gerin: {{ he(Wolfar) }} can be mild as milk when it suits {{ him(Wolfar) }}, but cross {{ him(Wolfar) }} and {{ he(Wolfar) }} raves.”
“It’s the streak of wereblood in {{ him(Wolfar) }},” {{Gerin}} said. “It runs thinly in many families on both sides of the Niffet, you know, but strong in {{ his(Wolfar) }}.” {{ He(Wolfar) }} told {{Ricolf}} what had happened to {{Wolfar}} when Nothos and Math were full together.
The older {{ baron(Gerin) }} frowned. “I had not heard of that. If I had, I’d never have asked {{ him(Wolfar) }} here. Lucky such conjunctions are rare.”
For all their joy over driving away the Trokmoi, neither {{Gerin}}'s followers nor {{Ricolf}}’s could work up much revelry. The day was drawing to a close. Both bands were exhausted. Even Van, as dedicated a roisterer as was ever born, contented {{ himself(Van) }} with little more than the single mug of ale {{ he(Van) }} had asked of {{Ricolf}}. The troops gnawed at smoked beef and hard bread, cheese and sun-dried fruit. Then they sought bedrolls or fell asleep where they sat. {{Gerin}} woke in {{Ricolf}}’s great hall at sunrise the next morning, still holding the same half-empty cup over which {{ he(Gerin) }}’d dozed off.
The day passed in watchful waiting. Everyone expected the Trokmoi to try to restore their siege. But the morning slipped by with no sign of the barbarians. Tiwaz rose at noon, overlooking only peace. Elleb followed a couple of hours later. {{ He(Elleb) }} was trailed at hourly intervals by Math and pale Nothos, and all was still quiet.
“I think you may have driven them away for a while,” {{Ricolf}} said to {{Gerin}}. The Fox pointed to heaven, wishing {{Ricolf}}’s words into the ear of Dyaus.
As people began to realize the woodsrunners would not be back at once, they began the celebration they’d been too worn to unleash the night before. {{Gerin}} and {{Ricolf}} quickly saw they could not stop it: the warriors needed release. The barons did what they could, ordering a few reliable soldiers to stay sober and stand sentry lest the Trokmoi dare a night attack.
Among the troopers {{Gerin}} chose was {{Amgath}} Andar’s {{ son(Amgath) }}, {{Nordric}} One-Eye’s driver. {{Nordric}} {{ himself(Nordric) }} happened to be close by. {{ He(Nordric) }} reinforced the Fox’s orders: “Keep your eyes open, you {{ son(Amgath) }} of an unwed moose, or I’ll wear your ears on a necklace.”
“Does {{ he(Nordric) }} always use {{ hisd(Nordric) }} people} so?” {{Ricolf}} whispered to {{Gerin}}.
“No. Usually {{ he(Nordric) }}’s worse.”
Someone by the main gate got out a mandolin and began to play. {{Gerin}} thought fleetingly of Tassilo and Rihwin, and of how a couple of foolish drunks had changed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} life. Leaving {{Elise}} tomorrow, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought, would be harder in its own way than facing the Trokmoi: that {{ he(Gerin) }} had done many times. But only once had {{ he(Gerin) }} left the {{ woman(Elise) }} {{ he(Gerin) }}’d come to love, and then in hands {{ he(Gerin) }} thought safe. Now, even behind {{Ricolf}}’s sheltering walls, {{Elise}} was in nearly as much danger as {{ he(Gerin) }}.
When one of {{Ricolf}}’s soldiers passed {{ him(Ricolf) }} an earthen jug of ale, {{ he(Ricolf) }} gave it back still corked. {{ He(Ricolf) }} knew drink would only lower {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} spirits further. {{ He(Ricolf) }} watched as Van came up with {{ hisd(Van) }} clay flute to accompany the mandolin-player. The {{ man(Gerin) }} who had offered {{Gerin}} ale soon joined them with one of the long horns the Trokmoi favored. That surprised the Fox; few Elabonians played the northern instrument. The music was loud and cheery, but powerless to expel {{Gerin}}'s gloom.
The sun sank and was forgotten. Most of the troopers in the holding gathered by the gate. Song followed bawdy song. Sentries shouted refrains from the stations on the wall. When too many throats grew dry at once, Van spun things along with a tale of {{ hisd(Van) }} days on the plains of Shanda, a story of high daring and higher obscenity. Then the soldiers roared into another ballad.
To escape the gaiety {{ he(Gerin) }} could not share, {{Gerin}} wandered into the castle’s great hall. {{Dyaus}}’ altar had no offering before it now, nor were the benches crowded with feasters. One warrior snored atop a table. {{ Hisd(warrior1) }} head rested in a puddle of dark, sticky ale. In a corner, another trooper was kissing the neck of a serving {{ maid(lover1) }}. Neither {{ he(warrior2) }} nor {{ hisd(warrior2) }} partner paid the Fox any mind.
{{Gerin}} walked through the dark hall, kicking at rushes and bones. Once in the corridor beyond, {{ he(Gerin) }} stopped and looked about: which sconce’s torch, {{ he(Gerin) }} wondered, had {{ he(Gerin) }} used to flatten {{Wolfar}}? Was it the one by that much-scarred wooden door, or its neighbor a few feet down the hallway? Unable to recall, {{ he(Gerin) }} turned a corner—and almost ran into {{Elise}}.
Later {{ he(Gerin) }} realized {{ he(Gerin) }} must have been trying to find {{ her(Elise) }}, searching for the one happiness {{ he(Gerin) }}’d found in a collapsing world. At the moment, no thoughts intruded. {{ She(Elise) }} was warm in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} arms. {{ Herd(Elise) }} lips and tongue met {{ his(Gerin) }} with the same desperation {{ he(Gerin) }} felt. “Where—?” {{ he(Gerin) }} whispered, stroking {{ herd(Elise) }} hair.
“Follow me.”
It was, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought, the chamber in which {{ he(Gerin) }}’d slept on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} way south. That seemed fitting, somehow. {{ He(Gerin) }} chuckled under {{ hisd(Gerin) }} breath. {{Elise}} made a questioning sound. {{ He(Gerin) }} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. “It’s nothing, love.”
The straw of the mattress rustled as {{ he(Gerin) }} drew {{ her(Elise) }} down. {{ She(Elise) }} softly cried out beneath {{ him(Gerin) }}, three times: first in pain, then in wonder, and then, at last, in joy.
When {{ she(Elise) }} rose to leave, the pain of separation was nearly more than {{Gerin}} could bear. {{ She(Elise) }} bent down for a last kiss, said softly, “Come back to me,” and was gone. {{ He(Gerin) }} was sure {{ he(Gerin) }} would toss for hours after the door closed behind {{ her(Elise) }}. Almost at once, though, {{ he(Gerin) }} fell into a deep and dreamless sleep.
<h2>XI</h2>
It was nearly noon the next day before the Fox and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} companions began the last leg of their journey. {{ He(Gerin) }} left the wagon behind. {{Ricolf}} lent {{ him(Gerin) }} {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} own stout three-man chariot, and with it a lean, weathered {{ man(Priscos) }} named {{Priscos}} {{ son(Priscos) }} of Mellor, {{ hisd(Ricolf) }} driver and shield{{ man(Priscos) }}.
{{Gerin}} suspected {{Ricolf}} guessed what had happened the night before, why {{ he(Gerin) }}’d left the celebration so early. It showed in no overt way but, as the Fox made small talk with the older {{ man(Ricolf) }} while getting ready to leave, {{ he(Gerin) }} felt an acceptance, a closeness between them of a different sort from their earlier friendship. {{ He(Gerin) }} was glad. {{Ricolf}}’s good opinion mattered to {{ him(Gerin) }}.
{{Elise}}’s farewell was wordless. {{ He(Gerin) }} tasted tears on {{ herd(Elise) }} lips as they kissed goodbye. {{ He(Gerin) }}, Van, and {{Priscos}} climbed into {{Ricolf}}’s chariot; {{Nordric}} and {{Amgath}} were beside them, as were Rihwin and Effo, the survivors of the fighting tail the Fox had recruited along the way, and a few volunteers from {{Ricolf}}’s holding. They were twenty-two in all, with four three-man and five two-man chariots.
{{Priscos}} clucked to the horses. The little army started to move. The gatekeepers lowered the drawbridge. One of them caught {{Gerin}}'s eye as {{ he(Gerin) }} passed. “What are you running off with this time, my {{ lord(Gerin) }}?” {{ he(Priscos) }} asked.
“Nothing you don’t see, Vukov,” the Fox answered, pleased {{ he(Gerin) }} remembered the {{ man(retainer1) }}’s name. {{ He(Gerin) }} doubted the gatekeeper had had a happy time the morning after {{Elise}} left. {{ He(Gerin) }} turned for a last glimpse of {{ her(Elise) }}, but the cramped confines of the gatehouse already blocked {{ hisd(Gerin) }} view.
{{Priscos}} was a {{ man(Priscos) }} of few words, most of them about horses. “You don’t see many Shanda beasts hereabouts,” {{ he(Priscos) }} remarked. “Where did you come by this one?”
“What’s the name of that town in the mountains, {{Gerin}}?” Van asked.
“Cassat.”
“Aye. That’s where I picked him up. Cheap, too—the clod of a horse-trader didn’t know what {{ he(merchant) }} had. He’s been a rare worker.”
“They’re ornery, I hear,” {{Priscos}} said. {{ He(Priscos) }} went on, more to {{ himself(Priscos) }} than {{Gerin}} or Van, “Reckon I can handle that, though.” {{Gerin}} was sure {{ he(Priscos) }} could. {{Priscos}} had an air of quiet competence {{ he(Gerin) }} liked.
As the sun sank, they camped by what had been the border station between {{Ricolf}}’s land and Bevon’s. Now the square wooden building which had housed {{Ricolf}}’s guardsmen was only charred ruins. One more debt to pay, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} thought, among so many.
The ghosts were strange that night. Their keenings and wailings were more intense, and also more nearly understandable, than the Fox had ever heard. One in particular flitted round {{ him(Gerin) }} as if drawn like moth to flame. For all its efforts, {{ he(Gerin) }} could neither make sense of what it would tell {{ him(Gerin) }} nor recognize its pallid form in the flickering firelight.
“That is an uncanny thing,” Rihwin said, watching the wraith’s frantic but vain efforts to communicate.
“Likely it’s like a Shanda spirit, seeking to lure you away from the light so it can drink your blood,” Van said.
{{Gerin}} shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. “I feel no harm in it, even if I can’t understand what it would say. Besides, Van, every ghost in the north country must have had a glut of blood by now.”
To that the outlander had no reply but a grave nod.
Remembering the fraternal strife tearing Bevon’s barony even before the Trokmoi invaded, {{Gerin}} wanted to cross it in a single day if {{ he(Gerin) }} could. {{ He(Gerin) }} did not want to camp inside it: if {{ he(Gerin) }} could expect night marauders anywhere, Bevon’s tortured land would be the place.
And tortured it was. The Fox’s band passed two battlefields before the sun was high in the southeast. The woodsrunners had plundered both fields, but all the bloated, naked corpses seemed to be Elabonians. Here {{ brother(Van) }} had fought {{ brother(Van) }}, and fought with a hate greater than they turned against the Trokmoi.
As {{ he(Gerin) }} surveyed the second meadow filled with bodies, {{Gerin}}'s face was stony and full of bitterness. “Poor fools,” {{ he(Gerin) }} said. {{ He(Gerin) }} wondered if {{ hisd(Gerin) }} words were not an epitaph for all the northland.
Whichever {{ brother(Van) }} had won the war, {{ he(Van) }} had not enjoyed victory long. A lot of the keeps still standing were held by small bands of Trokmoi. They hooted in derision as they saw {{Gerin}}'s force go by, but did not move against it. “They think us beneath contempt,” the Fox said to Van, “and perhaps we are.”
“Honh! The next time I care what a woodsrunner thinks will be the first.”
A bit more than halfway through Bevon’s barony, they passed a roadside holding destroyed in a way {{Gerin}} had never imagined before. The timbers of one whole wall of the palisade lay like jackstraws in the bailey, as if kicked in by a monster boot. The stone keep itself was a pile of broken rubble.
Something white stuck out from under one limestone slab. As the {{ baron(Gerin) }} drew closer, {{ he(Gerin) }} saw it was the skeleton of a human hand and arm, picked clean of flesh by scavengers. No one, Elabonian or Trokmê, garrisoned this keep.
“This is the work of your {{Balamung}}?” Rihwin asked.
“{{ He(Balamung) }}’s not mine. I wish with all my heart I’d never heard of {{ him(Balamung) }},” {{Gerin}} said, but {{ he(Gerin) }} had to nod as {{ he(Gerin) }} spoke. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} warriors eyed the shattered keep with awe, fear, and wonder. Hand-to-hand fighting against the Trokmoi was all very well, but how could they hope to hold against sorcery like this? Even {{Nordric}} was grim and quiet.
“I wonder why such powerful wizardry has not been used further south,” Rihwin said. “Few castles could stand against it, yet here, so close to the Niffet, is the first sign we’ve had of anything more than a simple barbarian invasion.”
“What difference does it make?” {{Gerin}} said bleakly, staring once more at the blasted holding.
“Maybe none, maybe a great deal. One explanation I can think of is that your northern mage may have so much trouble trying to lay low one particular keep—I name no names, mind you—that {{ he(Balamung) }} has had little leisure to help {{ hisd(Balamung) }} people elsewhere.”
{{Gerin}} gave {{ him(Rihwin) }} a grateful look. The line of hope the southerner had cast {{ him(Gerin) }} was thin, but {{ he(Gerin) }} was all but drowning in despair. Anything that buoyed {{ hisd(Gerin) }} spirits was welcome.
{{ Hisd(Gerin) }} renewed optimism and {{ his(Gerin) }} hope of crossing Bevon’s lands in one day both collapsed not long after noon. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} band came to the top of a low rise. There they stopped in horror and dismay. For the next three or four miles, the Elabon Way and most of the surrounding landscape had been brutally wiped out of existence. All that was left was a ruined expanse of raw-edged muddy craters, some a hundred feet across and twenty deep. They overlapped one another in the mangled earth, as if the same giant who had pulverized the keep had then amused {{ himself(Van) }} by pelting the ground with thousands of huge boulders. But there were no boulders, no visible explanation of how the devastation had been committed.
Chariots were not built to cross such terrain. Twice {{Gerin}} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} band had to stop to mend wheels battered by half-buried fragments of roadbed and tree-trunk, and once more to fix the axle of Nordric’s car when it broke.
Van repaired it with bronze nails, leather lashings, and a large measure of hope. {{ He(Van) }} said, “It may hold, and then again it may not. All we need now is for a horse to break a leg in this mess.”
{{Gerin}}'s fingers moved in a protective sign. “May the ears of the gods be closed to you.”
They barely managed to escape the ruined land before the sun set. All four moons were low in the east, slow-moving Nothos being most nearly full and Tiwaz still closest to first quarter.
That night the ghosts were louder and more insistent than {{Gerin}} had over known them. Again, one in particular tried to deliver some message to {{ him(Gerin) }}; again, {{ he(Gerin) }} did not understand. Although {{ he(Gerin) }} failed, something in {{ him(Gerin) }} responded to the ghost, as if it was the shade of someone {{ he(Gerin) }} had once known well. Irked by the riddle {{ he(Gerin) }} could not solve, {{ he(Gerin) }} pored over Rihwin’s grimoires until sleep overtook {{ him(Gerin) }}.
{{ He(Gerin) }} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} troopers came on another band of desolation not far into the lands of Palin the Eagle. This was worse than the one before: the ravaged area held several streams and ponds. Their water made the trek a nightmare of slimy, clinging mud.
In some places, chariots sank axle-deep in the muck. The warriors had to get out and slog through it on foot to lighten the load enough to let the horses move the cars at all. Soldiers and beasts alike were filthy and exhausted when at last they reached flat, solid ground. To {{ hisd(Gerin) }} disgust, {{Gerin}} found several fat leeches clinging to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} legs.
Though some daylight was still left, the Fox decided to camp when {{ he(Gerin) }} came to an unfouled creek in which to wash. Most of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} band, spent by the day’s exertions, collapsed into slumber almost at once.
Only Rihwin kept any semblance of good cheer. That surprised {{Gerin}}. {{ He(Gerin) }} had expected the southern dandy to be dismayed at {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} present unkempt state.
“Oh, I am, my fellow Fox, I am,” {{ he(Rihwin) }} said with a grin when {{Gerin}} asked, “but what, pray, can I do about my plight save laugh? Moreover, I truly begin to think {{Balamung}} has wreaked all this havoc for no other purpose than sealing aid away from your lands. Did you not tell me a mage was warding your keep?”
“Aye, or so I hope, at any rate: Siglorel Shelofas’ {{ son(Siglorel) }}. {{ He(Siglorel) }}’s southern-trained, true, but I don’t know how long {{ he(Siglorel) }} can stand against one such as {{Balamung}}. For one thing, {{ he(Siglorel) }} drinks too much.”
“By your reckoning, so do I, yet did it keep you from bringing me along on this mad jaunt? Also, never forget that while crisis makes cravens of some, in others it burns away the dross and leaves only their best.”
“From your mouth to {{Dyaus}}’ ear,” {{Gerin}} said, touched again by Rihwin’s efforts to reassure {{ him(Gerin) }}. What the southerner was saying held just enough sense to keep {{ him(Gerin) }} thoughtful, too: maybe {{Balamung}} did have some unknown reason to fear {{ him(Gerin) }}. And maybe, {{ he(Gerin) }} told {{ himself(Gerin) }}, I’ll do as Van says and flap my arms and fly to Fomor. Neither was likely.
Despite the gift of fowls’ blood, the ghosts were a torrent of half-seen motion, a clamorous murmur of incomprehensible voices. The spirit which had visited {{Gerin}} on the two previous nights returned once more. {{ He(Gerin) }} could see its ill-defined features writhing in frustration as it failed again to impart its tidings.
“You know, captain,” Van said, “I may be daft, but I think the poor wraith even looks a bit like you.” {{Gerin}} shrugged. For one thing, though the ghosts were extraordinarily immanent of late, they remained cloudy and indistinct. For another, the Fox, like most folk in the Empire and the lands it knew, had only a vague idea of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} features. Mirrors of polished bronze or silver were uncommon and expensive; even the best gave images of poor quality. {{ He(Gerin) }} probably had not seen {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own reflection more than a dozen times since taking over {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ father(Duren) }}’s barony.
The holding of Raff the Ready, Palin’s vassal who had guested {{Gerin}} and Van on their way south, was only a burnt-out shell. The little pond beside it was rubble-choked and fouled with the bodies of soldiers and beasts. {{Gerin}} viewed the ruins with sadness, but little surprise. Too many years of peace had led Raff to neglect {{ hisd(Raff) }} walls. {{ He(Raff) }} could not have put up much of a fight, not in {{ hisd(Raff) }} dilapidated keep.
Late that afternoon, the Fox passed from Palin’s land and entered {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own once more. The roadside guardhouses on either side of the border were deserted, but had not been burnt. The borderstone itself had been uprooted by the Trokmoi. {{Gerin}} cursed when {{ he(Gerin) }} saw its moss-covered runes effaced by fylfots chipped into the rock, as if {{Balamung}} was claiming the land for {{ hisd(Balamung) }} own.
So, perhaps, {{ he(Balamung) }} was. {{Gerin}} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} band had not gone far before they tripped some sorcerous alarm the {{ wizard(Balamung) }} had planted. A misty image of the black-robed {{ sorcerer(Balamung) }} appeared in the road before them. “Back, are you, Fox, in spite of it all? Well, you’ll have no joy of it. My people will see to that, and soon.” With a scornful laugh, the projection vanished.
“The spell your enemy placed here was plainly set to react to you and no one else,” Rihwin said. “In which case—”
{{Gerin}} finished for {{ him(Rihwin) }}: “—there’s sure to be another charm in action now not far away, telling a few hundred woodsrunners to come down and make an end of me. Well, what can I do but go on? {{Balamung}} has thrown away the advantage of surprise in {{ hisd(Balamung) }} vainglory, for whatever that’s worth.”
Arms at the ready, they moved ahead as the sun sank low in the west. As they passed a tiny crossroads, a whoop from behind some brush told them they had been seen. Archers nocked arrows; spearmen tightened grips on their weapons.
They did not have long to wait. Chariots and infantry together, a veritable army thundered down the cross road toward them. At its head was {{Wolfar}} of the Axe. {{ Hisd(Wolfar) }} hairy features split in a bloodthirsty grin when {{ he(Wolfar) }} recognized the Fox. “What luck! It’s the {{ wench(Elise) }}-stealing sodomite {{ himself(Gerin) }}!” {{ he(Wolfar) }} roared to {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} followers. Then, to {{Gerin}}: “I’ll make a capon of you, to keep you from having such thoughts again!”
Had {{Wolfar}}'s rancor against the Fox driven {{ him(Wolfar) }} into the arms of the Trokmoi? {{Gerin}} would not have thought that even of {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} western neighbor, yet here {{ he(Wolfar) }} was.
There was scant time for such thought. {{Gerin}} shot at {{Wolfar}} but missed. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} arrow tumbled one of the warriors behind {{Wolfar}} out of {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} chariot. Rihwin and the other archers let fly too, dropping a couple of others and sending a chariot down in crashing ruin as one of its horses was hit. But to stand and fight was madness, for {{Wolfar}} had easily ten times {{Gerin}}'s force.
“North!” the Fox shouted to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} followers. “We’ll outrun the footsoldiers, at least, and meet {{ him(Wolfar) }} on more even terms.”
North they fled in the gathering dusk. {{Wolfar}} howled hatred close behind. Arrows flew up. Almost all went wide—the jouncing chariots made poor shooting platforms.
“Captain,” Van shouted in {{Gerin}}'s ear, “what in the five hells is that up ahead?”
Only {{ his(Gerin) }} will kept the {{ baron(Gerin) }} from hysterical laughter. Whatever else {{Wolfar}} was, {{ he(Wolfar) }} was shown to be no traitor. “What does it look like? It’s the {{ wizard(Balamung) }}’s lap dogs, come to finish us off. We’re on the horns of a dilemma, sure enough, but maybe, just maybe, they’ll gore each other instead of us.”
The leader of the Trokmoi was an immensely tall, immensely fat blond barbarian who filled most of a three-man chariot by {{ himself(barbarian2) }}. {{ He(barbarian2) }} stared in dismayed amazement at the force of chariotry bearing down on {{ him(barbarian2) }}. Instead of the small band {{ he(barbarian2) }}’d expected, this looked like the leading detachment of an army as large as {{ hisd(barbarian2) }} own.
{{ He(barbarian2) }} frantically reined in, shouting, “Deploy, you spalpeens! Don’t be letting ’em get by you, now!” The Trokmoi shook themselves out into a wide line of battle, some afoot, others still in their cars.
But {{Gerin}} did not intend to take evasive action. {{ He(Gerin) }} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} soldiers stormed toward the center of the Trokmê line, hoping to slash through and then let the northerners and {{Wolfar}}'s followers slaughter each other to their hearts’ content. But the Trokmoi were too many and too quick to be broken through so easily. They swarmed round the Fox’s chariots, slowing the momentum of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} charge and stalling {{ him(Gerin) }} in their midst.
Their huge leader left {{ hisd(barbarian2) }} car to swing a great bludgeon with deadly effect. {{ He(barbarian2) }} crushed the skull of Rihwin’s chariot-mate, then lashed out at {{Priscos}}. {{Gerin}}'s driver took the blow on {{ hisd(Priscos) }} shield. It all but knocked {{ him(Priscos) }} from the chariot. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} chopped at the Trokmê with an axe. The barbarian, quicker than {{ hisd(barbarian2) }} girth would have suggested, ducked the stroke.
A horse shrieked as a woodsrunner drove a dagger into its belly.
For a moment, Rihwin was close by {{Gerin}}. “We’ve got to get out of here!” {{ he(Rihwin) }} cried.
“If you have any notion how, I’d love to hear it,” {{Gerin}} said.
A barbarian tried to climb into {{ hisd(Gerin) }} chariot. Van hit the {{ man(barbarian2) }} in the face with a chakram-braceleted forearm. {{ He(barbarian2) }} screamed through a torn, blood-filled mouth and fell away.
Then, suddenly, the pressure of the woodsrunners on {{Gerin}}'s beleaguered band slackened as {{Wolfar}} hurled {{ himself(Wolfar) }} into the sea of Trokmoi after the {{ man(Gerin) }} {{ he(Wolfar) }} hated. “{{ He(Gerin) }}’s mine, you arse-lickers! {{ He(Gerin) }}’s mine!” {{ he(Wolfar) }} roared.
The barbarians turned to meet this new and much more dangerous threat. {{Gerin}} tried to extricate {{ hisd(Gerin) }} people from the now three-cornered battle. It was not easy. The Trokmoi had not forgotten them, and to {{Wolfar}}'s froops the woodsrunners were only obstacles blocking the way to their real target.
Unnoticed by anyone in the melee, the sun sank below the horizon. As it set, the four moons rose within seconds of one another, all of them full. The last time that had happened had been close to three centuries before Elabon’s capital was founded.
Huge tides swamped low-lying coastal areas, drowning small towns and wrecking great ports. Prophets the world around cried doom.
And in those lands where the taint of wereblood ran through a folk, no moons at quarter or crescent counteracted the pressure to change shape exerted by the light of a full moon’s disk. Those with only the thinnest, most forgotten trace of wereness were now liable, indeed compelled, to take beast form.
Hills off to the east briefly shielded the battlefield from the rays of the rising moons. Then they topped the low obstacle and washed the fighters in their clear, pale light. {{Gerin}} was trading axe-cuts with a scrawny, green-eyed Trokmê who fought without armor when {{ hisd(Gerin) }} foe dropped {{ hisd(Gerin) }} weapon, bewilderment and alarm on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} face.
The Fox had no idea what was happening to {{ him(Gerin) }}, but was not one to let any advantage slip. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} stroke was true, but the northerner ducked under it with sudden sinuous ease. The Trokmê’s body writhed, twisted … and then the {{ baron(Gerin) }} was facing no Trokmê, but rather a great wildcat. It spat fury and leaped at {{ him(Gerin) }}.
{{ He(Gerin) }} had no time to wonder if {{ he(Gerin) }} had lost {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind. Razor-sharp claws tore at the bronze facing of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} shield, snarling jaws full of jagged teeth snapped at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} arm. {{ He(Gerin) }} brought {{ hisd(Gerin) }} axe crashing down between the mad eyes of the cat, felt its skull splinter under {{ hisd(Gerin) }} blow. Hot blood spattered {{ hisd(Gerin) }} arm. The carcass lay still a moment, twitching.
{{Gerin}} stared in disbelief. The awful wound {{ he(Gerin) }} had inflicted healed before {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eyes. Bones knit, skin and fur grew together as {{ he(Gerin) }} gaped. The wildcat’s eyes opened and caught sight of {{ him(Gerin) }}. It yowled, gathered itself for a second spring—and was bowled over and spun to the ground by an outsized wolf. They rolled away, locked in a snarling, clawing embrace.
The battlefield was a world gone mad. At first the Fox thought some spell of {{Balamung}}’s, intended for {{ hisd(Gerin) }} destruction, had gone awry. {{ He(Gerin) }} soon realized the chaos was far too general for anything of that sort.
Then, quite by accident, {{ he(Gerin) }} saw the four full moons. Understanding came, but brought no relief, only terror. Nearly half the fighters had gone were, in one beast-shape or another. The field was littered with corselets, greaves, and helms they escaped when the change came over them. The were-creatures fought former friends, foes, and fellow beasts with an appalling lack of discrimination.
A bellow of red rage from beside {{Gerin}} made {{ him(Gerin) }} whip {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head around, fearful lest Van too was falling under the influence of the moons. Not so: the outlander, in dispatching one of {{Wolfar}}'s people who had remained both human and combative, had taken a cut on {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} forearm.
More and more, those who kept their human form left off fighting one another and banded together against the ravening werebeasts. At the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s side were three Trokmê foot soldiers, but neither they nor {{ he(Gerin) }} had any leisure in which to quarrel.
The werebeasts were so lithe and fast, they found it easy to slip through the quickest human guard and fasten claws or fangs on flesh. Even when they were killed, the human soldiers gained only momentary respite from their onslaught. Within seconds of taking the most ghastly wounds, they grew whole once more.
Warriors caught away from their fellows were for the most part quickly killed. One pair of exceptions was {{Nordric}} One-Eye and {{ hisd(Nordric) }} driver {{Amgath}}. Their chariot had foundered in the middle of the field when Van’s repairs failed at last and the car’s axle broke beneath it.
The werebeasts made short, dreadful work of their horses, but {{Nordric}} was in full berserker rage, and fast and savage as any shape-changer. With one mighty stroke of {{ hisd(Nordric) }} sword {{ he(Nordric) }} cut a leaping werewolf in two, then seized its tail and hurled the spouting hindquarters far away. “Live through that, you backscuttling demons’ get!” {{ he(Nordric) }} shouted.
Still, had the werebeasts not battled each other with the same ferocity they gave those who had not changed, they would have made short work of them all. As it was, boar stomped and tusked wolf, a pair of wildcats sprang at a stag. The stag tossed one away with a wicked swipe of its antlers, but went to its knees as the other reached its back. Then the werewolf was beset in turn by a gigantic badger.
The shape-changers, {{Gerin}} noted, seemed to keep the same body weight they had possessed as humans. A couple of hawks far too heavy to fly stumped about the battlefield. Their cruel beaks gaped as they screamed challenge to all and sundry. Nor were they long without foes. A wolf attacked one, a fox the other. Between beaks, talons, and battering wings, both soon had cause to regret it.
The majority of the werebeasts were wolves, foxes, or wildcats, but deer, boar, bear, badger, and wolverine were all commonly represented. Along with these mundane creatures, though, were several oddities. One of {{Wolfar}}'s followers must have had some Urfa blood in {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} past, for a miniature but combative were-camel, moaning, snorting, and spitting, struck shrewd blows with its forefeet at the carnivores assailing it.
Off to one side lay a tremendous salmon, a corselet still round the middle of its body. It flopped and gasped in the air it could not breathe. It could not die, either, because of the vitality of its wereblood.
In the convulsions of the field, two transformed creatures stood out. One was the wolf which had been {{Wolfar}}. {{ Hisd(Wolfar) }} passion against {{Gerin}} was so fierce that {{ he(Wolfar) }} kept it in beast shape. {{ He(Wolfar) }} fought to force {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} way through the press and close {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} jaws on the Fox’s throat. {{ Hisd(Wolfar) }} howls of fury held almost understandable curses buried within them.
Yet even the were-{{Wolfar}} gave way before a great tawny longtooth which, from its bulk, must have been the animal shape of the swag-bellied Trokmê commander. It flailed its way through the imbroglio with hammerlike blows of its paws, blows that sent even werebeasts reeling back, stunned.
The monster cat came up to the stalled chariot in which {{Nordric}} and {{ hisd(Nordric) }} driver still held out. {{Amgath}} snapped {{ hisd(Amgath) }} long lash at it, hoping to keep it at a distance. It squalled in pain and anger but, instead of being repulsed, ran at {{ him(Amgath) }}. {{ He(Amgath) }} dropped the whip and grabbed a short thrusting-spear. Too late. A single cuff crushed {{ hisd(Amgath) }} face and broke {{ hisd(Amgath) }} neck.
The longtooth’s rush overturned the chariot and tumbled {{Nordric}} among the ravening werebeasts. {{Gerin}} was sure {{ he(Gerin) }} was doomed. In an instant, though, {{ he(Gerin) }} was on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} feet, a sword in either hand. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} curses pierced the cacophony of beast-noises around {{ him(Gerin) }}. {{ He(Gerin) }} seemed to face every way at once, flashing blades keeping death at bay. {{ He(Gerin) }} drove off one werebeast after another. Trokmoi and Elabonians shouted together.
Their cheers turned to groans as {{ he(Gerin) }} went down, a wildcat clinging to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} back. Van leaped from the chariot and ran to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} rescue. The wolf that had been {{Wolfar}} bounded toward {{ him(Gerin) }}, slavering jaws agape, yellow eyes blazing hatred.
The outlander was ready when it sprang. A blow of {{ hisd(Van) }} spiked mace shattered its skull. The wereflesh healed with unnatural speed, but Van was past by the time the wolf regained its feet. {{ He(Van) }} kicked the cat away from {{Nordric}}. It lashed out at the first thing it hit, another, even bigger, wildcat. While they tried to gut each other with raking claws, Van hauled {{Nordric}} erect. Side by side, they fought their way back to the chariots.
{{Nordric}} was battered and bleeding, but still full of fight. {{Gerin}} and Van had to hold {{ him(Nordric) }} back from throwing {{ himself(Nordric) }} once more against the were-longtooth that had killed {{Amgath}}.
“There’s no vengeance to gain against a beast you cannot kill,” {{Gerin}} said. “{{ He(Wolfar) }}’ll be in human shape again, you know—maybe you’ll meet {{ him(Wolfar) }} then.” {{Nordric}} let {{ himself(Nordric) }} be persuaded, a true measure of the punishment {{ he(Nordric) }} had taken.
{{Wolfar}}'s chief lieutenant, {{Schild}} Stoutstaff, had not gone were. Now {{ he(Schild) }} began to rally to {{ himself(Schild) }} such of {{ hisd(Schild) }} {{ lord(Wolfar) }}’s followers as were left. The Trokmoi, too, gravitated toward a pair of their nobles.
{{Gerin}} thought it a good time to vanish discreetly from the field. Followed by all {{ hisd(Gerin) }} surviving troops—Rihwin and {{Nordric}} in the former’s chariot and three more warriors in another car—{{ he(Gerin) }} edged toward the cover of the woods.
Their departure went unmarked by still-struggling humans, but one werebeast saw. The wolf that was {{Wolfar}} bayed angrily and started to lope after them. Before {{ he(Wolfar) }} could clear the battlefield, the longtooth knocked {{ him(Wolfar) }} down from behind. It tried to bury its fangs in were-{{Wolfar}}'s neck. The werewolf tried to twist free, but {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} foe’s great weight held {{ him(Wolfar) }} down.
{{Wolfar}} writhed, wriggled, and clamped {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} teeth on one of the longtooth’s forelegs. Bones crunched. The longtooth screamed. It tore at the wolf’s belly with its hind feet. {{Wolfar}} let go, but only to snap at the longtooth’s throat. Any greater purpose was forgotten in the fighting madness now gripping {{ him(Wolfar) }}. Outmatched physically, {{ he(Wolfar) }} was nearly the longtooth’s match because of the fury that drove {{ him(Wolfar) }}.
{{Gerin}} thanked the gods {{ he(Gerin) }} and the poor handful of followers left {{ him(Gerin) }} had made good their escape. Giving quiet directions to {{Priscos}}, {{ he(Gerin) }} guided them north through a web of tiny trails. No one who had not lived in the barony could have followed them in the dark.
At last {{ he(Gerin) }} judged it safe to stop. The din of battle had long since died behind {{ him(Gerin) }}, but the night was far from still. More than the usual number of animals ranged the woods. Many were people caught in the open by the werenight and now running wild, bloodlust in their souls.
That led to another thought: what hell was the werenight playing in keeps under siege—especially in Castle Fox (always assuming it had not fallen)? “Don’t worry about it, captain,” Van said when {{Gerin}} spoke aloud. “Whatever’s going on inside, it’s just as bad out, and that you can bet on. {{Balamung}} or no, the Trokmoi’ll be in no shape to take advantage of things tonight. Maybe a weresnake will swallow the cur and solve our problem for us.”
“Such happy endings happen more often in romances than in fact, I fear,” {{Gerin}} said, but the outlander had heartened {{ him(Gerin) }}.
Something else occurred to Rihwin: “Great {{Dyaus}} above! I wonder what’s happening south of the mountains?” The Fox shied away from that idea. With even a small part of its populace turned were, the capital’s narrow, winding streets and dark alleys would be a worse jungle than any forest through which {{ he(Gerin) }}’d pass. {{ He(Gerin) }} thought of {{Turgis}} and hoped the innkeeper was safe.
Not so the Sorcerers’ Collegium. {{ He(Gerin) }} started to send a curse down on its head, then stopped, suddenly ashamed of {{ himself(Gerin) }}. “Now I understand why the southern mages offered me no help!” {{ he(Gerin) }} exclaimed. “They must have known this was coming, and been making ready to meet it. {{Sosper}} as much as told me so. No wonder they needed to keep every soul they had in the southlands.”
Despite exhaustion, {{Gerin}} found sleep hard to come by. So did {{ hisd(Gerin) }} people: they were all in pain from wounds taken fighting the Trokmoi, {{Wolfar}}'s warriors, or the werebeasts.
Also, the light of the four full moons seemed to allow the ghosts fuller access to this plane than at more normal times. They floated round the campfire, sometimes darting up to one or another of the soldieres to try to give such advice as each thought important. Thanks to the moons, they were sometimes able to make themselves understood, but that understanding did not always make their listeners see why the wraiths deemed their news important.
“What possible difference does it make to me that the price of barley in the capital dropped two coppers a bushel three days ago?” Rihwin demanded. The spirit that told {{ him(Rihwin) }} did not explain.
The ghost that had been straining for days to get through to {{Gerin}} drifted toward {{ him(Gerin) }} again. “Captain, I take oath it looks like you,” Van said. “Face a little wider, maybe, but leave out that and what looks like a broken nose and it could be your twin—”
“Father {{Dyaus}} above!” {{Gerin}} whispered. “{{Dagref}}, is it you?” {{ He(Gerin) }} moved to embrace {{ hisd(Gerin) }} slain {{ brother(Dagref) }}’s shade, but it was like trying to hold a breeze.
The ghost withdrew a few paces, slowly and sadly shaking its head. {{Gerin}} recalled that gesture well. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} older {{ brother(Dagref) }} had always used it when the Fox did something foolish.
The memory brought sudden tears to the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s eyes, though {{ he(Gerin) }} and {{Dagref}} had not always been close. {{Dagref}} was half a dozen years older, while {{Gerin}}, as {{ he(Gerin) }} approached adulthood, found the soldier’s life {{Dagref}} took to so naturally did not suit {{ him(Gerin) }} at all. Or so I thought then, {{Gerin}} said to {{ himself(Gerin) }}: here I am living it.
The lips of {{Dagref}}'s ghost were moving, but the Fox still could not make out any words. {{ He(Gerin) }} heard {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ brother(Dagref) }}’s voice in {{ his(Gerin) }} mind, but so windblown and blurred by echoes that {{ he(Gerin) }} could not grasp {{Dagref}}'s meaning. “Once more,” {{ he(Gerin) }} begged.
The wraith grimaced in exasperation, but started over. This time its meaning, or a sentence of it, was clear: “You still don’t keep the stables as clean as our father would have liked,” {{Dagref}}'s ghost said. It shook its head again in the gesture so familiar to {{Gerin}}, then, satisfied it had finally got across what was necessary, disappeared into the darkness, leaving {{Gerin}} more bewildered than before.
“What did it say?” Van asked. {{Gerin}} told {{ him(Van) }}. Van tugged at {{ hisd(Van) }} {{ beard(Van) }}, gave the Fox a quizzical look. “It’s hounded you for days to let you know you’re a scurvy excuse for a housekeeper? Tell me, captain, was your {{ brother(Dagref) }} crack-brained?”
“Of course not.” The news {{Dagref}}’s ghost had given was plainly important to it. {{Gerin}} cursed {{ himself(Gerin) }} for failing to see why. {{ He(Gerin) }} turned the ghost’s enigmatic words over and over in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mind, but came no closer to understanding them.
Half a night’s sleep brought no new insight. {{ He(Gerin) }} was glad, though, when {{ he(Gerin) }} woke, to see the sun shining through the trees to the east and all the moons gone from the sky.
“You look like death warmed over,” Van said. “There’s dried blood all over your face.”
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} scrubbed with {{ hisd(Gerin) }} fingers, saying, “I must have done enough tossing and turning to open up a cut or two.” {{ He(Gerin) }} pounded left fist into right palm. “Damn everything, what was {{Dagref}} trying to tell me?”
{{ He(Gerin) }} got no good answer to that, either from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own wits or from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} comrades when {{ he(Gerin) }} put the riddle to them. “Perhaps {{ he(Dagref) }} wants you to have a good storage place for my cheap barley,” Rihwin suggested. {{Gerin}} glared at {{ him(Rihwin) }}, but it made as much sense as anything else.
Not long after they left camp, they came upon the mangled and partially eaten carcass of a brown bear. Beside it slept a naked Trokmê. Awakened by their approach, {{ he(barbarian1) }} leaped up and fled into the woods, red hair streaming behind {{ him(barbarian1) }}.
Rihwin stared in disbelief. “No {{ man(barbarian1) }} could—”
“And no {{ man(barbarian1) }} did,” Van said grimly. “Look at the tracks: bear and wildcat. It shouldn’t have been too hard. In were shape, the woodsrunner would have taken no hurt. Then {{ he(barbarian1) }} had {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} feast, curled up afterwards—and changed back when the moons set.
The forest path was punctuated by random death: another bear, horribly torn; a Trokmê with {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} throat ripped out; a pair of Elaboninan warriors so mutilated as to appall even {{Gerin}}'s hard-bitten crew; a crofter’s cottage, its flimsy door torn from leather hinges, a blackened puddle of blood luring flies at the threshold. {{Gerin}} did not need to look to be sure no one was alive inside. {{ He(Gerin) }} hoped the deaths there had been quick.
Live Trokmoi still lurked in the woods. An arrow from hiding grazed the side of {{Gerin}}'s helm. {{ He(Gerin) }} and Rihwin shot blindly into the undergrowth. The sniper, unhurt, let fly again, hitting {{Priscos}}’ left arm just below the shoulder. The driver cursed and tore out the arrow, then ripped at {{ hisd(Priscos) }} tunic for cloth to bandage the wound.
The rest of the Elabonians jumped from their chariots. They ran for cover, then stalked the barbarian sharpshooter. The Trokmê {{ man(barbarian2) }}, no fool, held {{ hisd(barbarian2) }} well-concealed position until {{ he(barbarian2) }} had what {{ he(barbarian2) }} thought was a good shot at Van. But in {{hisd(barbarian2) }} cramped quarters {{ he(barbarian2) }} could not draw bow to {{ hisd(barbarian2) }} ear, only to {{ hisd(barbarian2) }} chest. The outlander’s stout cuirass turned {{ hisd(barbarian2) }} shaft.
Van shouted in rage and rushed at the thicket from which the arrow had come. The Trokmê fled. A blow of Van’s mace felled {{ him(barbarian2) }} from behind before {{ he(barbarian2) }} had taken ten strides. Like a charging longtooth, the outlander was deadly quick in a short rush.
{{ He(Van) }} surveyed the sniper’s corpse without a hint of remorse. “A pity the craven bushwhacker didn’t die slower,” {{ he(Van) }} said. “If {{ he(barbarian2) }} wanted to fight, {{ he(barbarian2) }} should have come at us like a real {{ man(barbarian2) }}.”
{{Gerin}} had planned and executed enough ambushes in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} time to keep a discreet silence.
When they returned to the chariots, {{Priscos}} was matter-of-fact. “Did you get {{ him(barbarian2) }}?” {{ he(Priscos) }} asked. At {{Gerin}}'s nod, {{ he(Priscos) }} said, “Good,” and jerked the reins to get the horses moving north again.
They returned to the Elabon Way no more than a couple of hours’ journey south of Fox Keep. {{Gerin}} was sickly aware {{ he(Gerin) }} was returning without even the ragtag army which had set out from {{Ricolf}}’s holding. The werenight had seen to that. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} main hope now was that it had disrupted {{Balamung}}’s people more than the Elabonians.
Then that hope died too. A shout rang out from the flanking forest: “Here’s more o’ the buggers!” A score and more of footsoldiers charged from the woods, spears ready to cast, swords bared.
But the Fox was still reaching for {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bow when {{ he(Gerin) }} realized the cry had been in {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own tongue, not the woodsrunners’. And when the onrushing warriors spotted {{ him(Gerin) }} (or more likely spied Van and {{ hisd(Van) }} distinctive armor), they stopped so abruptly that one {{ man(Van) }} stumbled and fell to {{ hisd(Van) }} knees. Then they came on again, but now in friendship and joy, raising a cheer to chill the heart of any Trokmê in earshot.
{{Gerin}} recognized them as {{Drago}} the Bear’s people; their commander was one of {{Drago}}’s chief retainers, {{Fedor}} the Hunter. The Fox did not know {{Fedor}} well. {{ He(Fedor) }} usually stayed behind at {{Drago}}’s keep as deputy when {{ hisd(Fedor) }} {{ lord(Drago) }} went to Castle Fox. But {{Gerin}} had never been gladder to see anyone than this heavyset, scar-faced warrior.
{{Fedor}} led {{ hisd(Fedor) }} people up to the Fox. “We thought you dead, my {{ lord(Gerin) }},” {{ he(Fedor) }} said accusingly. “The Trokmoi and their cursed {{ wizard(Balamung) }} claimed you were, when they tried to get me to yield the Castle of the Bear to them.”
“{{Drago}}’s holding stands?” {{Gerin}} said. “You beat back an attack the {{ wizard(Balamung) }} led {{ himself(Balamung) }}? Great {{Dyaus}}, {{Fedor}}, how? {{ Hisd(Balamung) }} magic has leveled more keeps than I can count.”
“Oh, {{ he(Balamung) }} tried to shake the holding down after I said no to {{ him(Balamung) }}, so {{ he(Balamung) }} did. Fires and smokes and flying demons and I don’t know what all. But the Castle of the Bear is good and solid, and it sits on bedrock. As for the rest”—he shrugged with the same stolidity {{Drago}} would have shown—“we were inside and they were outside, and that’s the way it stayed. The {{ wizard(Balamung) }}’s lightnings blasted one breach, but no woodsrunners came through it alive. They paid a lot more than half the butcher’s bill, my {{ lord(Gerin) }}. After a while, they’d had enough and went away.”
Listening to the bald report, {{Gerin}} decided {{Fedor}} had not had the imagination to see {{ he(Fedor) }} had no chance. And, going on phlegmatically where a more perceptive {{ man(Fedor) }} would have despaired, {{ he(Fedor) }} had endured. Something to be said for dullness after all, the Fox thought.
But {{Fedor}} was not yet done. “You need not look so surprised, my {{ lord(Gerin) }}. Fox Keep still holds too, you know.”
The {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s heart gave a great bound within {{ him(Gerin) }}. “No,” {{ he(Gerin) }} said softly. “I did not know.”
“Aye, it does.” {{Fedor}} seemed oblivious to the impact {{ hisd(Fedor) }} news had on the Fox. “They’re under siege, true, but they managed to sneak a messenger to us through the woodsrunners’ lines: some trick of your {{ wizard(Siglorel) }} Siglorel, I understand. Sixty fighters set out from the Castle of the Bear two days ago, but after last night—” {{ He(Fedor) }} shrugged again. “For a while I thought I’d lost my wits, but I was too busy staying alive to worry about it.”
“Weren’t we all?” {{Gerin}} said.
Thanks to the footsoldiers, the final approach to Fox Keep was slower now, but {{Gerin}} would not have traded them for all the treasures of Ikos. A final fear gripped {{ him(Gerin) }}: that the keep had fallen after its messenger went out, Then Van pointed north. “Right on the skyline, captain—the very tip of your watchtower. And I think”—he squinted—“aye, I think it’s your banner atop it.
As {{ his(Gerin) }} soliders exulted, {{Gerin}} tried to follow {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend’s pointing finger. {{ He(Gerin) }} had to say, “Your eyes are better than mine.” But that Van saw what {{ he(Van) }} claimed, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had no doubt. {{ He(Gerin) }} had surmounted every stumbling block now, save the last … putting an end to the mightiest mage the world had seen in two thousand years. And even as {{ he(Gerin) }} quickened {{ hisd(Gerin) }} pace toward {{ hisd(Gerin) }} castle, {{ he(Gerin) }} realized {{ he(Gerin) }} still had no idea how to do that.
<h2>XII</h2>
Castle Fox had taken a fearful beating, {{Gerin}} saw as {{ he(Gerin) }} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} people sped toward it. Part of one wall had fallen, to be replaced by a lower, makeshift bulwark of timbers and earth. For some reason, the logs of the palisade were painted a sour dark green. Though the watchtower still stood, gaps had been bitten into some of the upper stonework of the keep.
Still, on the whole the Trokmê investment was a shabby job. Mighty {{ sorcerer(Balamung) }} or no, {{Balamung}} was only a woodsrunner when trying to besiege a holding {{ hisd(Balamung) }} magic could not flatten. {{ He(Balamung) }} knew nothing of engines or stratagems, but had to rely on the ferocity of {{ hisd(Balamung) }} troops—and ferocity counted for little against a fortress with determined defenders. Broken bodies littered the ground below the palisade. Here as at the Castle of the Bear, their bravery and inexperience were making the Trokmoi pay more than their share of blood.
But what ferocity could do, it would. Just out of bowshot from the palisade, {{Balamung}} harangued {{ hisd(Balamung) }} followers, nerving them to yet another charge against out-wall and gate. Despite the repeated maulings the Elabonians had given them, despite the horrors of the werenight just past, they waved their weapons and cheered at {{ hisd(Balamung) }} speech, for all the world like so many outsized, destructive children.
The Fox’s people on the palisade caught sight of {{Gerin}} before the Trokmoi did. Their yells made {{Balamung}} pause in mid-word. {{ He(Balamung) }} looked up. An evil orange glow lit {{ hisd(Balamung) }} eyes. {{ Hisd(Balamung) }} voice sounded inside the Fox’s head, scornful and exasperated at the same time: “It’s infernally hard to kill that you are. Well, so long as you’re here, you can watch your fine castle die, for I’m fresh out of patience with your puppydog of a {{ wizard(Siglorel) }}, indeed and I am.”
The lean {{ sorcerer(Balamung) }} gave quick orders to {{ hisd(Balamung) }} troops. Fifty or so loped toward the Fox (“Just to make sure you don’t joggle my elbow, now,” {{Balamung}} said). The rest advanced on the palisade. The {{ baron(Gerin) }} found their discipline remarkable—and alarming. {{ He(Gerin) }}’d hoped {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sudden advent would draw all the barbarians from the walls and free {{ hisd(Gerin) }} troops inside to sally against them.
The first arrow hissed past {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. Another found the breast of one of Rihwin’s proud dapples. The southerner’s chariot slewed, flipped over. {{ He(Rihwin) }} and {{Nordric}}, both veterans of such mishaps, landed lightly. They were on their feet at once to face the oncoming Trokmoi.
More arrows flew past. The Fox shot a couple in return. Then {{ he(Gerin) }} yelled to {{Priscos}}, “We’d all better get down. The horses will just have to take their chances.”
The driver chewed {{ hisd(Priscos) }} lip, unhappy at the thought of abandoning the beasts but knowing not all spills ended so luckily as Rihwin’s. {{ He(Priscos) }} pulled to a halt, {{ hisd(Priscos) }} long face doleful. Sword in hand, {{ he(Priscos) }} followed {{Gerin}} and Van to the ground.
{{ He(Priscos) }} ran to the horses. Evading a snap from the Shanda pony, {{ he(Priscos) }} slashed through their traces and slapped both beasts’ rumps with the flat of {{ his(Priscos) }} blade. They galloped away, leather straps trailing. {{Priscos}} gave {{Gerin}} a wintry grin. “All right, my {{ lord(Gerin) }}, I expect I’m ready now.”
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} had no time to answer—the Trokmoi were upon them. {{ He(Gerin) }} glimpsed a hurled stone just in time to flick up {{ hisd(Gerin) }} shield and knock it aside. A wild-haired northerner, naked but for a helm and one greave, thrust at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} legs with a short pike. {{ He(Gerin) }} skipped aside.
Van rammed {{ hisd(Van) }} own, longer, spear into the Trokmê’s belly. {{ He(Van) }} jerked it free with an expert twist. Bloody entrails came with it.
At first, progress toward Fox Keep was not hard. Though outnumbered almost two to one by the Trokmoi {{Balamung}} sent to hold them off, the Elabonians had better weapons and armor than their foes. But soon the lack of order the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had looked for before began to cost {{ hisd(Gerin) }} relieving force. More and more Trokmoi gave up the attack on the palisade and ran toward the hand-to-hand fighting they loved so well. Their {{ wizard(Balamung) }} leader cursed shrilly and tried to bend them to {{ hisd(Balamung) }} will again, but had little luck. {{ Wizard(Balamung) }} or no, leader or no, {{ he(Balamung) }} could not change the habits of the proud, wild folk {{ he(Balamung) }} led.
A tall noble in brightly burnished scale-mail confronted the Fox. “It’s Dumnorix {{ son(barbarian1) }} of Orgetorix {{ son(barbarian1) }} of—” {{ he(barbarian1) }} began. {{ He(barbarian1) }} got no farther, for an arrow—a Trokmê arrow, by its length and fletching—suddenly sprouted in {{ hisd(barbarian1) }} throat and sent {{ him(barbarian1) }} spinning to the ground.
Then the {{ baron(Gerin) }} was facing a woodsrunner who must have learned {{ hisd(Van) }} swordplay from an Elabonian. Forsaking the usual slashing style of the Trokmê, {{ he(Van) }} thrust wickedly at {{Gerin}}'s face, belly, and face again. {{ Hisd(Van) }} wrist was quick as a snake. But Rihwin sprang to {{Gerin}}'s side. {{ Hisd(Van) }} slim blade darted at the Trokmê. Unable to stand against two such swordsmen, the barbarian sprang back among {{ hisd(Van) }} comrades.
Both sides slowed to a brief, panting halt. Not fifteen feet from the Fox, a sweaty barbarian leaned on {{ hisd(barbarian2) }} spear. {{ He(barbarian2) }} was picking {{ hisd(barbarian2) }} teeth with a gory forefinger. {{ He(barbarian2) }} caught {{Gerin}}'s eye and grinned. “Good fighting.” And in truth, that was all the twisted corpses, the gashed limbs, the terror and agony meant to {{ him(barbarian2) }}: a sport, something to enjoy and at which to excel.
{{Gerin}} wearily shook {{ hisd(Gerin) }} head. Too many on both sides of the border felt thus.
Someone threw a stone. Someone else cast a spear. The heat of battle again grew to a boil. Shouting like those struck mad, a wedge of Trokmoi slammed into the middle of {{Gerin}}'s thin line, splitting {{ hisd(Gerin) }} force in two.
The larger half, led by {{Nordric}}, made for the repaired breach in the palisade. That, thought {{Gerin}}, was largely because {{ hisd(Gerin) }} berserker comrade saw more Trokmoi there than anywhere else. {{Nordric}} and {{ hisd(Nordric) }} companions fought their way into range of covering arrows from the palisade. Its defenders cheered their every forward step.
For {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own fragment, which included Van, Rihwin, and {{Priscos}}, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} had another goal: {{Balamung}} {{ himself(Balamung) }}. The black-robed mage, hood flung back to show {{ hisd(Balamung) }} face, stalked menacingly round the palisade. Under one arm {{ he(Balamung) }} carried the Book of Shabeth-Shiri. The codex was bound in light, fine-grained leather, perhaps tanned human hide.
No arrow bit the {{ wizard(Balamung) }}, though the soldiers on the palisade sent many {{ hisd(Balamung) }} way. Some flared into brief blue flame, others flew wild, others simply vanished. Arrogant and contemptuous, {{Balamung}} stood, dry, under a rain of death.
{{ He(Balamung) }} opened the Book of Shabeth-Shiri and began to chant. Even fighting desperately afurlong away, {{Gerin}} felt the power the {{ wizard(Balamung) }} gathered, saw the air around {{ him(Balamung) }} shimmer with pent-up energies. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} hair tried to prickle upright under {{ hisd(Gerin) }} helm.
The Trokmoi who had been assaulting the wall of the palisade on which the spell would fall sprinted away for their lives. {{Balamung}}’s chant rose to a crescendo. {{ He(Balamung) }} shouted in the dread Kizzuwatnan tongue, paused, shouted again.
Sheets of red flame flowed from {{ hisd(Balamung) }} fingertips. The fire engulfed the wall of the palisade. {{Gerin}} watched in awe and consternation. Not even ashes, {{ he(Gerin) }} thought, could remain when that incandescent flood receded. But the palisade withstood the fiery bath unharmed, still the same sour green which had bemused the Fox before.
“I think your own {{ wizard(Siglorel) }} has won a point,” Rihwin said, parrying a spearthrust. That was a notion new to {{Gerin}}. It had not occurred to {{ him(Gerin) }} that the ugly paint might be a sorcerous defense.
{{Balamung}} shouted in frustrated wrath. {{ Hisd(Balamung) }} flapping black cloak gave {{ him(Balamung) }} the aspect of a starveling vulture. {{ He(Balamung) }} loped toward the repaired section of the palisade, crying to Siglorel, “Southron fool, you’ll pay for not bending the knee to me!” Less than a bowshot from where {{Gerin}} battled {{ hisd(Balamung) }} minions, the Trokmê mage opened {{ hisd(Balamung) }} fell grimoire and began another spell.
Redoubling their efforts, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} soldiers tried to close with the {{ wizard(Balamung) }} while {{ hisd(Balamung) }} sorcery distracted {{ him(Balamung) }}. But they had all they could do to stay alive; pushing forward against the barbarians was impossible.
The Fox could only watch as fire shot once more from {{Balamung}}’s hands. It caught and clung to the untreated timbers of the improvised barricade—and to the back of a woodsrunner not quick enough to get away. A human torch, {{ he(barbarian1) }} shrieked and fell and burned. {{Gerin}}'s troops within Fox Keep braved arrows to beat at the flames with hides and pour water and sand on them, but could not douse the wizardfire.
Then Siglorel, clad in robes no less black than {{Balamung}}’s, appeared at the top of the burning stretch of palisade. As Rihwin had said, when faced with the supreme challenge of {{ hisd(Siglorel) }} life {{ he(Siglorel) }} turned {{ hisd(Siglorel) }} back on the alepot and fought {{Balamung}}’s spells to a standstill. Now {{ he(Siglorel) }} worked with unhurried skill, ignoring the missiles flying around {{ him(Siglorel) }}. {{ Hisd(Siglorel) }} fingers flashed in intricate passes. As {{ hisd(Siglorel) }} hands fell when {{ hisd(Siglorel) }} spell was done, the flames fell too, leaving the bulwark smoldering but intact.
“You dare to show yourself in my despite?” {{Balamung}} hissed. {{Gerin}} shuddered at the malice in {{ hisd(Balamung) }} voice. Siglorel gave {{ hisd(Siglorel) }} foe a tired, grave nod. “Then dare—and die!” {{Balamung}}’s arm swept down. Lightning cracked from a clear sky. A flick of Siglorel’s hand sent the bolt smashing harmlessly to the ground.
The backlash of energies from the mages’ duel—and simple fear, too—held Trokmoi and Elabonians frozen where they stood, unwilling witnesses to a struggle more dire than any in which they fought. {{Balamung}} was clearly the stronger. The lightnings {{ he(Balamung) }} hurled crashed ever closer to {{ hisd(Balamung) }} enemy, {{ hisd(Balamung) }} whirlwinds spun up great clouds of choking dust that all but hid the palisade, {{ hisd(Balamung) }} demons flew shrieking through the winds and dove on Siglorel like huge bat-winged falcons.
No levinbolt, though, seared through Siglorel’s heart, no wind seized {{ him(Siglorel) }} and flung {{ him(Siglorel) }} to {{ hisd(Siglorel) }} doom (though the warrior who had been at {{ hisd(Siglorel) }} side had time for but one brief scream of terror as {{Balamung}}’s tornado tore {{ him(barbarian1) }} from Castle Fox), no demon drank {{ his(barbarian1) }} blood. Face gone dead white from strain, hands darting now here, now there like those of a {{ man(barbarian1) }} wracked by fever, Siglorel somehow kept an ever-tightening circle of safety round {{ himself(Siglorel) }}.
Once or twice {{ he(Siglorel) }} even managed to strike back. {{Balamung}} contemptuously swatted aside {{ hisd(Siglorel) }} lightnings, as if they were beneath {{ hisd(Balamung) }} notice. The end, {{Gerin}} saw, was inevitable. {{Balamung}} cursed in balked outrage as {{ hisd(Balamung) }} weaker opponent evaded destruction again and again, but each escape was narrower, each drained more of Siglorel’s waning strength.
Then the Trokmê {{ wizard(Balamung) }} chuckled terribly. {{ He(Balamung) }} briefly checked the Book of Shabeth-Shiri. At {{ hisd(Balamung) }} gesture, a plane of pulsing violet light sprang into being on either side of Siglorel. As {{Balamung}} brought {{ hisd(Balamung) }} hands toward each other, the planes of force {{ he(Balamung) }} had created began to close upon {{ hisd(Balamung) }} antagonist. Siglorel tried to check the inexorable contraction, but all {{ hisd(Siglorel) }} knowledge, all {{ hisd(Siglorel) }} cantrips, were of no avail against the ancient, mighty sorcery {{Balamung}} commanded.
Ever nearer each other drew the planes of force, so that now Siglorel held them apart not with {{ hisd(Siglorel) }} magic, but by the power of {{ hisd(Siglorel) }} strongly muscled arms and shoulders. The desperate tableau held for half a minute, no more; then only a crimson smear lay between the glowing planes.
{{Gerin}} expected {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own life to be similarly crushed away, but {{Balamung}}, a cat toying with a helpless mouse, took too much pleasure in the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s dismay to end the game so quickly. Full of noxious confidence, {{ hisd(Balamung) }} voice sounded in the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s ear: “First you can watch your fine keep fall. Then I’ll get round to dealing with yourself—if my lads have not done it for me.”
That seemed likely. {{Gerin}} and Van fought back-to-back much of the time now. Many of the warriors who had accompanied them were gone. Attacked at the same time by one Trokmê with a sword and two more with spears, {{Priscos}} went down while {{Balamung}} was speaking. Rihwin and {{Gerin}} killed the spearmen, but {{Priscos}} lay where {{ he(Priscos) }} had fallen.
{{Balamung}} began another spell. A clot of black smoke rose before {{ him(Balamung) }}. It quickly began to take shape and solidity. Even after {{ hisd(Balamung) }} invocation ceased, that which {{ he(Balamung) }} summoned continued to grow.
The demon was roughly anthropoid, but twice the height of any man, and broad in proportion. Forced to bear its huge mass, its short thick legs were bowed, but they carried it well enough. Its huge arms, hanging almost to the ground, ended in grasping, taloned hands. Its skin was black and green, and wet like a frog’s. It was grossly {{ male(demon) }}.
Its chinless lower jaw hung slack, showing row on row of saw-edged teeth. A bifurcated tongue lashed in and out. The demon had no nose, only red slits to match the banked fires of its eyes. Above those eyes, its forehead sloped straight back. Its batlike ears swiveled and twitched at every sound.
Obeying {{Balamung}}’s shouted command, it waddled toward Castle Fox. The Trokmoi scattered before it. As {{ he(Gerin) }} watched it near the keep, {{Gerin}} saw a plume of smoke curl up from within the palisade. One of the outbuildings was alight, whether from {{Balamung}}’s magic or a mere fire-arrow {{ he(Gerin) }} did not know.
The {{ wizard(Balamung) }} saw it too. {{ He(Balamung) }} laughed. “You’ll no more be putting your betters in the stables to sleep, will you now?”
At their mage’s order, the Trokmoi raked the palisade with arrows, forcing its defenders to keep their heads down. A few Elabonians shot back. Two arrows pierced the demon. It wailed and gnashed its teeth, but did not slow.
Then {{Nordric}} rushed at it, a sword in either hand, curses rising even over its cries. All the barbarians around {{ him(Nordric) }} had fled at the demon’s onset, but in {{ hisd(Nordric) }} blind fury {{ he(Nordric) }} knew only the attack. The demon stopped as {{ he(Nordric) }} charged. It was confused, no doubt, to see a human running toward it.
Then confusion gave way to a full-throated bellow of pain and rage, for {{Nordric}}’s first stroke ripped into its thigh. Purplish-red ichor spurted from the wound. {{Gerin}} and the Elabonians cheered frantically, and were joined by more than a few Trokmoi not happy with the unholy ally {{Balamung}} had given them.
But the demon, faster than its bulk suggested, slipped by {{Nordric}}’s next rush. An arm longer than {{ he(Nordric) }} was tall snaked out. A huge hand seized {{ him(Nordric) }} in a chest-crushing embrace. No last oath passed {{ hisd(Nordric) }} lips as {{ hisd(Nordric) }} swords fell from nerveless fingers. The demon brought the fresh-killed dainty to its mouth. The horrible jaws slammed shut. The monster flung what was left of the broken body behind it and resumed its advance on the palisade.
Reaching the repaired section of wall, it grasped a charred timber near the top. Enormous muscles bunched under its glabrous hide. The timber groaned, screamed, and came loose with a splintering crash. The demon tossed it aside, grabbed another and pulled it free, then another and another.
More arrows thudded into its flesh, but so thick were its muscles that they guarded its vitals almost as well as a corselet. The Trokmoi shouted in excitement as they saw the barrier torn apart.
When the breach was all but complete, an Elabonian with more courage than sense attacked the demon with a spear. A heavy forearm knocked aside {{ hisd(barbarian2) }} weapon. The demon lashed out with a broad, flat foot. The Elabonian’s body, torn nearly in two by that terrible kick, flew through the air to land well within the courtyard of Fox Keep.
{{Balamung}} cried out once more in whatever fell tongue {{ he(Balamung) }} used to control the monster {{ he(Balamung) }} had summoned. It turned away from the keep, moved ponderously toward {{Gerin}} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} embattled comrades. The smoke from the burning stables grew thicker as the warriors who had been fighting the flames abandoned that task to meet the Trokmoi swarming into the breach.
More afraid of their hideous partner than the human foes they were facing, the woodsrunners who had opposed the Fox gave way as the demon neared. Out of the corner of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} eye, {{Gerin}} saw Van closely studying the oncoming monster. The tight smile on the outlander’s face puzzled {{ him(Gerin) }} until {{ he(Gerin) }} realized {{ hisd(Gerin) }} friend had at last found a foe to overawe {{ him(Van) }}.
Then shouts from the keep made every head whirl. The demon, bat-ears unfurled to the fullest extent, turned to meet the new challenger bearing down on it. {{Duin}} the Bold, mounted on a horse and carrying the biggest spear {{ he(Duin) }} could find, had rammed {{ hisd(Duin) }} way through the Trokmoi at the breach. {{ He(Duin) }} thundered toward the monster, shouting to draw its attention from {{Gerin}} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} companions.
The part of the Fox’s mind which, regardless of circumstances, observed and recorded fine details, now noted that {{Duin}} was not riding bareback. {{ He(Duin) }} sat on a rectangular cloth pad cinched tight round the horse’s middle. {{ Hisd(Duin) }} feet were in leather loops depending from either side of the pad.
{{Duin}} rode straight at the demon, which gathered itself to meet {{ him(Duin) }}. {{ Hisd(Duin) }} lance, powered by the hard-charging horse, plunged deep into the monster’s belly. The improvised stirrups kept {{ him(Duin) }} atop {{ hisd(Duin) }} mount and added even more impact to the blow. The gore-smeared bronze spearpoint jutted from the demon’s back.
Its roar of agony filled the field. Though blood bubbled over its lips, it plucked {{Duin}} from {{ hisd(Duin) }} horse and slammed {{ him(Duin) }} to the ground. {{ He(Duin) }} lay unmoving. The demon’s shrieks faded to gurgles. It swayed, toppled, fell. Clawed fingers opened and closed on nothing, then were still.
But {{Balamung}} did not let the Trokmoi dwell on the defeat of {{ hisd(Balamung) }} creature. “Have no fear,” {{ he(Balamung) }} said. “I’m after having more of the beasts, which they’ll not find easy to stop. And look: the palisade’s broken, and there’s fire in the courtyard. One more good push and we’ll need push no more.” {{ He(Balamung) }} opened the Book of Shabeth-Shiri, began again the dreadful invocation which had called the demon from its plane.
{{Gerin}} looked from the congealing smoke of the Trokmê’s magic to the smoke puffing up from the stables—the stables where {{Balamung}} had slept three years before, the stables which, as {{ hisd(Gerin) }} {{ brother(Dagref) }}’s ghost had reminded {{ him(Gerin) }}, had not been well cleaned from that time to this.
Sudden wild hope burned through {{ him(Gerin) }}. If a single one of {{Balamung}}’s hairs was buried in the old dry straw of the burning outbuilding—and if {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own memory still held the spell {{ he(Gerin) }} had learned from Rihwin more out of sheer annoyance from any expectation it would ever be of use … “What have I to lose?” {{ he(Gerin) }} muttered to {{ himself(Gerin) }}, and began.
A woodsrunner leaped at {{ him(Gerin) }} when {{ he(Gerin) }} dropped {{ hisd(Gerin) }} sword and shield. Van stretched the {{ man(barbarian1) }} lifeless in the dirt. The outlander had no idea what {{ hisd(Van) }} friend was doing, or indeed whether {{ he(Gerin) }} still had all {{ hisd(Gerin) }} wits, but would guard {{ him(Gerin) }} as long as breath was in {{ hisd(Van) }} body.
Chanting in the harsh Kizzuwatnan tongue, left hand moving through passes fast as {{ he(Gerin) }} dared, the Fox went to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} knees in the first of the three required genuflections. As {{ he(Gerin) }} rose, {{ he(Gerin) }} remembered the words of the {{Sibyl}} of Ikos, words {{ he(Gerin) }} had thought filled only with doom. Confidence tingled along {{ hisd(Gerin) }} veins, warm like wine. {{ He(Gerin) }} grinned savagely. Aye, {{ he(Gerin) }} was bowing to the mage of the north, but {{ he(Gerin) }} did not think {{Balamung}} would appreciate the compliment.
That newfound confidence almost made {{ him(Gerin) }} careless. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} tongue stumbled in a particularly intricate passage of the spell. For a moment, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} body filled with frightening heat. But {{ he(Gerin) }} recovered and raced on, driving to be done before {{Balamung}} could finish {{ hisd(Balamung) }} own magic and realize {{ himself(Balamung) }} attacked. {{ He(Gerin) }} bowed for the last time, shouted the last Kizzuwatnan curse, and stood. If {{ he(Gerin) }} had blundered, {{ he(Gerin) }} would soon be dead, either from the recoil of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} spell or the overwhelming power of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} foe.
{{ He(Gerin) }} had won the race. {{Balamung}} was still incanting, {{ hisd(Balamung) }} demon materializing before {{ him(Balamung) }}. Half a minute passed in anticlimax. {{Gerin}} watched {{ hisd(Gerin) }} enemy in baffled despair. Then the fire in the stables reached the two or three hairs still left from the {{ wizard(Balamung) }}’s visit long before.
{{Balamung}} paused for an instant, brushing a sleeve of {{ hisd(Balamung) }} robe across {{ hisd(Balamung) }} forehead as if to wipe away sweat. Then little yellow flames licked at the robe, and at {{ hisd(Balamung) }} flesh as well. Smoke poured from {{ hisd(Balamung) }} body.
The half-formed demon vanished.
{{Balamung}} screamed, a cry of utmost anguish that stirred horror though from the throat of a foe. The {{ wizard(Balamung) }} beat at {{ hisd(Balamung) }} flaming chest with arms no less afire. {{ He(Balamung) }} knew the author of {{ hisd(Balamung) }} destruction the instant {{ his(Balamung) }} dreadful eyes seized the Fox’s. A clawlike hand speared at {{Gerin}} for a final malediction. Flame dripped down the pointing index finger before the spell was cast.
The all-consuming fire left of {{Balamung}} only gray flakes of ash. The wind tossed them high in the air and blew them away. {{ He(Balamung) }} had read {{ hisd(Balamung) }} stars aright: no one would ever know {{ hisd(Balamung) }} grave, for there was nothing of {{ him(Balamung) }} to bury.
And with {{ him(Balamung) }} burned the Book of Shabeth-Shiri. That evil tome, which had survived so long, seemed at the end more tenacious of life than the {{ wizard(Balamung) }} who briefly owned it. Only slowly did the flames grip its pages. {{Gerin}} would have taken oath that {{ he(Gerin) }} saw those pages flutter and rustle in an almost sentient effort to put out the fire and escape their fate. But the spells Shabeth-Shiri had amassed in ancient days now turned to smoke one by one, and as each was destroyed the power of the Book grew less. At last the fire engulfed it altogether, and it was gone.
A strange pause followed; neither side could quite believe {{Balamung}} had truly perished. {{Gerin}}'s followers in Fox Keep recovered first. Shouting, “The Fox! The Fox!” they battered their way through the dismayed Trokmoi at the breach and rushed toward the {{ baron(Gerin) }} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} few remaining comrades. The woodsrunners scattered before them.
{{Drago}} the Bear took {{Gerin}} in an embrace that hurt even through armor. Right behind {{ him(Drago) }} were {{Rollan}}, Simrin Widin’s {{ son(Rollan) }}, and most of the borderer crew. They were thinner and dirtier than the Fox remembered, but still warriors to be reckoned with, and happier than {{ he(Gerin) }} had ever seen them.
{{Gerin}} had hoped their onslaught, coupled with the death of the {{ wizard(Balamung) }} at {{ hisd(Balamung) }} moment of triumph, would send the Trokmoi fleeing for the Niffet. But a northern chieftain stopped the rout before it began. {{ He(Nordric) }} cut down with {{ hisd(Nordric) }} own hand a barbarian running past {{ him(Nordric) }}. “Are we warriors or snot-nosed weans?” {{ he(Nordric) }} roared. “It’s but southrons we’re fighting, not gods. They bleed and they die—and it’s not many of ’em are left to be killed!”
The Trokmoi sensed the truth in {{ hisd(Nordric) }} words. So, with sinking heart, did the Fox. Though magic had failed the barbarians, edged bronze might yet suffice. “We haven’t enough people to fight in the open here. Back to the castle before they cut us off,” {{ he(Gerin) }} commanded. “Keep the best order you can.”
{{Drago}} began to protest. {{ He(Drago) }} looked from the regrouping barbarians to the white scar over {{Gerin}}'s eye and thought better of it. For the first hundred yards or so, the retreat went smoothly. Then the Trokmoi gave a hoarse cheer and charged.
Direct as always, Van went straight for the northern leader, reasoning that {{ hisd(Nordric) }} death might kill the spirit {{ he(Nordric) }}’d given {{ hisd(Nordric) }} fighters. But not even the outlander’s might let {{ him(Van) }} bull {{ hisd(Van) }} way through the Trokmoi. Their noble commander declined combat. Like few barbarians {{Gerin}} knew, {{ he(Van) }} was aware {{ he(Van) }} had more value for {{ hisd(Van) }} band than {{ hisd(Van) }} sword-arm alone.
The {{ baron(Gerin) }} and {{ hisd(Gerin) }} followers were within the shadow of the palisade when Rihwin swore and fell, an arrow through {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} calf. An axe-wielding Trokmê leaped in for the kill. Though prone, Rihwin turned the first stroke with {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} shield. Before the woodsrunner could make a second, {{Drago}} speared {{ him(barbarian1) }} in the side. {{Gerin}}'s burly vassal slung Rihwin over {{ hisd(Drago) }} shoulder like a sack of turnips. {{ He(Drago) }} ran for the breach with the rest of the Elabonians.
Thus, through the gap torn in the palisade, {{Gerin}} re-entered Fox Keep, the outbuildings afire before {{ him(Gerin) }}, the Trokmoi hard on {{ hisd(Gerin) }} heels. Cursing the noble who had rallied the northerners, {{ he(Gerin) }} shouted for pikemen to hold the gap.
The barbarians outside the keep listened to the passionate oratory of their self-appointed leader. With much argument and wasted motion, they formed a ragged line of battle. “At ’em!” the noble cried. Now {{ he(Nordric) }} led the charge {{ himself(Nordric) }}.
Arrows and javelins took their toll of the onrushing barbarians, but they did not waver. They slammed into the thin line the Fox had built against them.
Spear and shield, sword and corselet kept them out. Van was everywhere at once, smiting like a {{ man(Van) }} possessed, bellowing out a battle-song in the twittering tongue of the plains. {{ He(Van) }} hurled {{ hisd(Van) }} spear at the leader of the woodsrunners and cursed foully when {{ he(Van) }} missed.
{{ He(Van) }} took out {{ hisd(Van) }} rage on the Trokmoi nearest {{ him(Van) }}. Blood dribbled down the leather-wound handle of {{ hisd(Van) }} mace and glued it to {{ hisd(Van) }} hand. As always, {{Gerin}} fought a more wily fight, but {{ he(Gerin) }} was in the front line, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} left-handed style giving more than one woodsrunner a fatal half-second of confusion.
When at last the Trokmoi sullenly pulled out of weapon-range, though, {{Gerin}} realized how heavy {{ hisd(Gerin) }} losses had been. Simrin Widin’s {{ son(Rollan) }} was on {{ hisd(Rollan) }} knees, clutching at an arrow driven through {{ hisd(Rollan) }} cuirass into {{ hisd(Rollan) }} belly. {{Fandor}} the Fat lay dead behind {{ him(Rollan) }}, along with far too many others. Almost everyone who could still wield a weapon was at the breach, and almost everyone bore at least one wound.
Shouts of alarm came from the watchtower and two sides of the palisade. “Ladders! Ladders!” The few defenders still on the wall raced to the threatened spots. One ladder, another, went over with a crash, but already red-mustached barbarians were on the walkway. They fought to hold off the Elabonians until their comrades could scale the wall for the final, surely victorious assault on Fox Keep.
{{Gerin}} knew such weariness as {{ he(Gerin) }} had never felt before. {{ He(Gerin) }} had endured the terrors of the werenight, slain a {{ wizard(Balamung) }} more deadly than the world had known for a score of centuries … for what? An extra hour of life. Merely for the lack of a few soldiers {{ hisd(Gerin) }} holding would fall despite all {{ he(Gerin) }} had done. A double-bladed throwing axe hurled from the walkway flashed past {{ him(Gerin) }}. It buried itself in the blood-soaked ground.
But instead of pressing home their attack, the Trokmoi cried out in despair and fear. The Fox’s troopers shouted in sudden desperate urgency. The barbarians on the wall fled back to their scaling-ladders and scrambled down them, trying to reach ground outside the keep before its defenders sent their escape routes toppling.
Bewildered, the {{ baron(Gerin) }} looked south and saw the most unlikely rescue force conceivable thundering toward Fox Keep. {{Wolfar}} of the Axe, in {{ man(Wolfar) }}’s shape once more, still had with {{ him(Wolfar) }} a good third of the two-hundred-person army {{ he(Wolfar) }} had led before the werenight. {{Gerin}} more than half expected {{Wolfar}}'s people to ignore the Trokmoi and attack {{ him(Gerin) }}, but they stormed down on the barbarians, the bloodthirsty {{ baron(Gerin) }} at their head.
The Trokmê noble tried to rally {{ hisd(Nordric) }} fighters yet again. {{Wolfar}} rode {{ him(Nordric) }} down. At {{ hisd(Nordric) }} fall, the woodsrunners broke and ran, flying in all directions. They had already taken one assault from the rear, and had kept their courage after {{Balamung}} died just as {{ hisd(Balamung) }} triumph seemed assured. Now courage failed them. They threw away weapons to flee the faster. Most ran for the Niffet, and most never reached it, for {{Wolfar}}'s warriors fought with savagery to match their overlord’s.
{{Gerin}} did not let {{ hisd(Gerin) }} troops join the pursuit. {{ He(Gerin) }} kept them drawn up in battle array at the breach, unable to believe {{ hisd(Gerin) }} long-time enemy would not try to deal with {{ him(Gerin) }} next. Their numbers were near even, though {{Wolfar}}'s people were fresher. But when {{Wolfar}} returned from the killing-ground, {{ he(Wolfar) }} and {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} vassal {{Schild}} stepped over the contorted bodies of the Trokmoi who had died before the palisade to approach Fox Keep unarmed.
“I ought to cut your liver out, Fox,” {{Wolfar}} said by way of greeting, “but I find I have reason to let you live.”
The notion galled {{Wolfar}} so badly, {{ he(Wolfar) }} could go no further. {{Schild}} spoke for {{ hisd(Schild) }} chief, over whom {{ he(Schild) }} towered—{{ he(Schild) }} was as tall and lean as {{Wolfar}} was short and stocky, and was one of the few serving under {{Wolfar}} whom {{Gerin}} respected. {{ He(Schild) }} said, “As you can guess, once we pulled ourselves together after whatever madness struck last night”—{{Gerin}} started to explain the werenight, but decided it could wait—“we came north after you. But a little south of here, we caught a woodsrunner fleeing your keep. {{ He(barbarian2) }} told us you’d killed their {{ wizard(Balamung) }}, the one you warned me of not long ago. Is it true?”
“Aye, it’s true. Dearly bought, but true.”
“Then you’ve earned your worthless life,” {{Wolfar}} said, looking toward the corpse of the demon {{Duin}} had killed. It was already starting to stink. “You’ve done a great thing, damn you, and I suppose I have to let it cancel what’s between us from the past.” {{ He(Wolfar) }} started to offer {{Gerin}} {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} hand, but could not bring {{ himself(Wolfar) }} to do it. The Fox knew there was still no liking or trust between them.
That was not so of their followers—soldiers from both sides broke ranks to fraternize. In their shared victory over {{Balamung}} and the Trokmoi, they forgot the enmity that had existed between them. Though {{ he(Gerin) }} did not want to do it, {{Gerin}} felt {{ he(Gerin) }} had no choice but to invite {{Wolfar}} and {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} troops to help man Castle Fox and make it defensible once more.
To the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s secret disappointment, {{Wolfar}} accepted at once. “A holding with too few soldiers in it is almost worse than none at all,” {{ he(Wolfar) }} said. “I worry about my own keep; those I left behind rattle around in it like dried beans in a gourd—do they not, {{Schild}}?”
“Hmm?” {{Schild}} gave {{ him(Wolfar) }} an unclassifiable look. “Aye, my {{ lord(Wolfar) }}, the garrison there is very small indeed.”
As {{Wolfar}}'s people filed into the holding, {{Gerin}} assigned them duties: some to the palisade, others to help some of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} own people plug the breach, still others to help the wounded or fight the fires still flickering in the outbuildings. {{Wolfar}} did not object to {{ hisd(Gerin) }} dispositions. {{ He(Wolfar) }} seemed content to let the Fox keep overall command inside Fox Keep.
{{Gerin}} was glad to find that Rihwin’s injury was not serious. “You’re not hamstrung, and the arrow went clear through your leg. Otherwise we’d have to cut it out, which is nothing to be taken lightly,” the {{ baron(Gerin) }} told {{ him(Rihwin) }}. “As is, though, you should heal before long.”
“If I put spikes on my wrists and ankles, do you think I’ll be able to climb trees like a cat?” Rihwin asked, adjusting {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} bandage.
“I see no reason why not.”
“Odd,” Rihwin murmured. “I never could before.”
“Go howl!” {{Gerin}} threw {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hands in the air and went off to see to other injured fighters. If the southerner could joke at {{ hisd(Rihwin) }} wound, {{ he(Rihwin) }} would soon mend.
Had they taken place at any other time, {{Gerin}} would have reckoned the next days among the most hectic of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} life. As if was, they scarcely stood comparison to what had gone before.
True, four days after {{Balamung}}’s fall, the Trokmê chieftain who had turned longtooth in the werenight led an attack on Fox Keep. By then, though, the breach in the palisade was repaired, and the holding had fresh supplies drawn from the countryside. Nor did the woodsrunner have patience for a siege. {{ He(Nordric) }} tried to storm the walls, and was bloodily repulsed. {{ He(Nordric) }} {{ himself(Nordric) }} jumped from a scaling ladder to the palisade walkway. {{Wolfar}} took {{ hisd(Nordric) }} head with a single stroke of the heavy axe that gave {{ him(Wolfar) }} {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} sobriquet.
Then the ladder went crashing over. Half a dozen Trokmoi tried to leap clear as it fell. The ladders that stayed upright long enough for the barbarians to come to grips with the Elabonians were few. After their leader was slain inside the keep, they lost their eagerness for the fight.
In a way, that second attack by the Trokmoi was a gift from the gods. It further united {{Wolfar}}'s people and {{Gerin}}'s against a common foe, and again reminded them how petty their old disputes were now. A good lesson, {{Gerin}} thought. {{ He(Gerin) }} regretted that the province north of the Kirs had not learned it sooner.
{{Wolfar}}, surprisingly, seemed to take the lesson to heart. {{ He(Wolfar) }} did not much try to hide {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} animosity toward {{Gerin}}, but {{ he(Wolfar) }} did not let it interfere with the running of the keep. {{ He(Wolfar) }} never mentioned {{Elise}}. {{ He(Wolfar) }} was as cordial as {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} nature allowed toward the {{ baron(Gerin) }}’s followers, and insisted on praising Fox Keep’s ale, though by now it was coming from the barrel-bottom and full of yeast.
{{Gerin}} would sooner have seen {{ him(Wolfar) }} surly. {{ He(Gerin) }} did not know how to react to this new {{Wolfar}}.
For Schild, on the other hand, {{ hisd(Gerin) }} admiration grew by leaps and bounds. When the Fox learned from a prisoner of a band of Trokmoi planning to raft over the Niffet, {{Wolfar}}'s lieutenant led a joint raiding party to ambush the barbarians as they disembarked. The ambush was a great success. The Trokmoi paddled back across the river after leaving a double handful of warriors dead on the shore.
On the raiders’ return, {{Wolfar}} was so lavish in their praise and so affable that {{Gerin}}'s suspicion of {{ him(Wolfar) }} redoubled. But beyond this uncharacteristic warmth, the thick-shouldered {{ baron(Wolfar) }} as yet showed no hint of what was in {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} mind.
“{{ He(Wolfar) }}’s given me every reason to trust {{ him(Wolfar) }},” {{Gerin}} told Van one night, “and I trust {{ him(Wolfar) }} less than ever.”
“Probably just as well for you,” Van said. {{Gerin}} was not sorry to find {{ hisd(Gerin) }} worries shared.
Word of {{Balamung}}’s death spread quickly. It raised the Elabonians’ spirits but disheartened their foes, who had leaned on the {{ wizard(Balamung) }}’s supposed invincibility. Two days after the defeat {{Schild}} had engineered for the band of southbound barbarians, a large troop of Trokmoi came north past Castle Fox. Except for keeping out of bowshot, they ignored the keep, intent on returning with their booty to the cool green forests north of the Niffet.
Another large band came by a day later, and another two days after that. As if the appearance of the third group of retreating Trokmoi had been some sort of signal, {{Wolfar}} stumped up to the Fox in the great hall and said abruptly, “Time we talked.”
Whatever {{Wolfar}} had been hiding, it was about to come into the open. Of that {{Gerin}} felt sure. Stifling {{ hisd(Gerin) }} apprehension, {{ he(Gerin) }} said, “As you wish. The library is quiet.” {{ He(Gerin) }} led {{ hisd(Gerin) }} western neighbor up the stairs.
{{Wolfar}} seemed less disconcerted by {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} strange surroundings than {{Gerin}} had hoped. “What a bastardly lot of books you have, Fox!” {{ he(Wolfar) }} said. “Where did you pick them all up?”
“Here and there. Some I brought back from the southlands, some I’ve got since, a few came from my {{ father(Duren) }}, and a couple I just stole.”
“Mmm,” {{Wolfar}} said. Then {{ he(Wolfar) }} fell silent, leaning back in {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} chair.
At last {{Gerin}} said, “You said you wanted to talk, {{Wolfar}}. What’s on your mind?”
“You don’t know, Fox?” {{Wolfar}} sounded honestly surprised.
“If it’s {{Elise}}, {{ she(Elise) }} won’t marry you, you know. {{ She(Elise) }}’d sooner bed a real wolf.”
“As if what {{ she(Elise) }} wanted had anything to do with it. Still, {{ she(Elise) }}’s only a—what word do I need?—a detail, maybe.”
“Go on.” Now {{Gerin}} was genuinely alarmed. This cold-blooded calculator was not the {{Wolfar}} {{ he(Gerin) }} had expected, save in {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} utter disregard for anyone else. The Fox wanted to keep {{ him(Wolfar) }} talking until {{ he(Gerin) }} had some idea of what {{ he(Gerin) }} was dealing with.
“I’d thought better of you, {{Gerin}}. We don’t get along, but I know you’re no fool. You have no excuse for being stone blind.”
“Go on,” {{Gerin}} said again, wishing {{Wolfar}} would come to a point.
“All right. On this stretch of the border, we have the only two major holdings that didn’t fall. Now tell me, what aid did we get from the Marchwarden of the North or our {{ lord(Emperor) }} {{Emperor}} Hildor?” {{Wolfar}} tried to put mockery in {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} voice, but managed only a growl.
“Less than nothing, as well I know.”
“How right you are. Fox, you can see as well as I—better, I suppose, if you’ve really read all these books—the Empire hasn’t done a damned thing for us the past hundred years. Enough, by all the gods! With the confusion on the border—and deep inside, too, from some of the things you’ve said—the two of us could be sovereigns so well established that, by the time Elabon moved its fat arse against us, we’d be impossible to throw out, you and I!”
No wonder {{Wolfar}} had changed, {{Gerin}} thought, whistling softly. Anyone carrying that big an idea on {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} shoulders would change, and might buckle under the strain of it. Something else bothered the Fox too, but {{ he(Gerin) }} could not place it. “What would you have us be sovereigns of?” {{ he(Gerin) }} asked. “Our side of the border is so weak the Trokmoi can come down as they wish, with or without their {{ wizard(Balamung) }}. For now, we can’t hope to hold them.”
“Think, though. We can channel their force into whatever shape pleases us. Save for them, we’re the only powers on the border now, and we can use them against whoever stands against us.”
That idea {{Gerin}} liked not at all. {{ He(Gerin) }} wanted to drive every woodsrunner back across the Niffet, not import more as mercenaries. {{ He(Gerin) }} said, “After a while, they’d decided they’d sooner not be used, and act for their own benefit, not ours.”
“With their {{ sorcerer(Balamung) }} gone, they could never hurt us, so long as we kept up enough properly manned and alert keeps,” {{Wolfar}} argued. {{ Hisd(Wolfar) }} elaborate calm worried {{Gerin}} more than any bluster or nervousness.
But at last {{ he(Gerin) }} had it, the thing {{Wolfar}} was trying to hide. The blank look {{Schild}} had given {{ hisd(Schild) }} commander, a few odd remarks from {{Wolfar}}'s people… everything fell together. “{{Wolfar}},” {{ he(Gerin) }} asked, “what were you doing on my land, away from your properly manned and alert keep, when you ran into me just before the werenight?”
“What do you mean?” {{Wolfar}}'s deep-set eyes were intent on {{Gerin}}.
“Just this: you’ve tried to bury me in a haystack without my noticing. It almost worked, I grant you—you’re more subtle than I thought.”
“You’ll have to make yourself plainer, Fox. I can’t follow your riddles.”
“Very well, I’ll be perfectly clear. You, {{ sirm(Wolfar) }}, are a liar of the first water, and staking everything on your lie not being found out. Your keep must have been sacked, and almost at once, or you’d still be in it, not trotting over the landscape like a frog with itchy breeches. In fact, you’re as homeless as a cur without a master.”
{{Wolfar}} took a long, slow breath. “Reasoned like a schoolmaster, Fox. But your logic fails you at the end.”
“Oh? How so?”
Heavy muscles rippled under {{Wolfar}}'s tunic. “I do have a home keep, you see: this one.” {{ He(Wolfar) }} hurled {{ himself(Wolfar) }} at {{Gerin}}.
The Fox sprang from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} seat and threw a footstool at {{Wolfar}}'s head. {{Wolfar}} knocked it aside with a massive forearm. Like a crushing snake, {{ he(Wolfar) }} reached out for the Fox. In the first moment of fighting, neither thought to draw sword. Their hatred, suppressed these past few days, blazed up out of control, too hot for anything but flesh against flesh, {{Gerin}} mad as {{Wolfar}}.
Then {{Wolfar}} kicked the Fox in the knee. {{ He(Wolfar) }} staggered back, hearing someone shriek and realizing it was {{ himself(Wolfar) }}. The bright pain cut through {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} bloodlust. When {{Wolfar}} roared forward to finish {{ him(Gerin) }}, {{ he(Wolfar) }} almost spitted {{ himself(Wolfar) }} on {{Gerin}}'s blade.
{{ Hisd(Wolfar) }} own was out the next instant. Sparks flew as bronze struck bronze. {{Wolfar}} used {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} sword as if it were an axe, hacking and chopping, but {{ he(Wolfar) }} was so quick and strong {{Gerin}} had no time for a telling riposte. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} movement hampered by {{ hisd(Gerin) }} knee, {{ he(Gerin) }} stayed on the defensive, awaiting opportunity.
It came, finally: a clever thrust, a twist of the wrist, and {{Wolfar}}'s blade and one finger went flying across the room. But before the Fox could pierce {{ him(Wolfar) }}, {{Wolfar}} kicked the sword from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hand and seized {{ him(Gerin) }} in a pythonic embrace.
{{Gerin}} felt {{ hisd(Gerin) }} ribs creak. {{ He(Gerin) }} slammed the heel of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} hand against {{Wolfar}}'s nose, snapping {{ his(Gerin) }} head back. In the capital they claimed that was often a fatal blow, but {{Wolfar}} merely grunted under it. Still, {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} grip loosened for an instant, and {{Gerin}} jerked free.
{{ He(Gerin) }} wondered briefly what was keeping everyone from bursting into the library and pulling the two of them apart. They were making enough noise to scare the Trokmoi in the woods, let alone the people in the castle. But no one came.
{{Wolfar}} leaped for a sword. {{Gerin}} tackled {{ him(Wolfar) }} before {{ he(Wolfar) }} could reach it. They crashed to the floor in a rolling, cursing heap. Then, like a trap, two horn-edged hands were at the Fox’s throat. Almost of their own accord, {{ his(Gerin) }} reached through {{Wolfar}}'s thick {{ beard(Wolfar) }} to find a similar grip. {{ He(Gerin) }} felt {{Wolfar}} tense under it.
{{Gerin}} tightened {{ hisd(Gerin) }} neck muscles as {{ he(Gerin) }} had learned in the wrestling schools of the capital, tried to force breath after precious breath into {{ hisd(Gerin) }} lungs. The world eddied toward blackness. In one of {{ hisd(Gerin) }} last clear moments, {{ he(Gerin) }} wondered again why no one was breaking up the fight. Then there was only the struggle to get the tiniest whisper of air and … keep … {{ hisd(Gerin) }} … grip … tight …
After that, all {{ he(Gerin) }} knew was the uprushing welcoming dark.
The first thing {{ he(Gerin) }} realized when {{ hisd(Gerin) }} senses returned was that {{ he(Gerin) }} was no longer locked in that death embrace. {{ Hisd(Gerin) }} throat was on fire. Van and {{Schild}} Stout-staff bent over {{ him(Gerin) }}, concern on their faces. {{ He(Gerin) }} tried to speak. Nothing came from {{ hisd(Gerin) }} mouth but a croak and a trickle of blood.
{{ He(Gerin) }} signed for pen and parchment. After a moment’s incomrpehension, Van fetched them. Quill scratching, {{Gerin}} wrote, “What happened?”
As reading was not one of {{ hisd(Van) }} many skills, Van held the scrap of parchment in some embarrassment. Seeing {{ hisd(Van) }} plight, {{Schild}} took it from {{ him(Van) }}. “‘What happened?’” {{ he(Schild) }} read. “My {{ lord(Gerin) }} {{Gerin}}, you are the only {{ man(Gerin) }} who knows that.”
{{Gerin}} looked a question at Van.
“Aye, {{Wolfar}}'s dead.” The outlander took up the tale. “When {{ he(Wolfar) }} and you went up to have your talk, the rest of us sat around the great hall wondering what would come of it. Then the racket started. We all looked at each other, hoping it was something simple, say a demon from one of the hells or {{Balamung}} back from the fire.
“But no, sure as sure, it was you two going at each other. We could have had a fight down there to match the one up here. If anybody had tried going up the stairs, that’s just what would have happened. So, though nobody said much, we figured whoever came out would rule here, and anyone who didn’t like it or couldn’t stand it would be free to go, no hard feelings. And we waited.
“And nobody came out.
“Finally we couldn’t stand it any longer. {{Schild}} and I came up together. When we saw you, we thought you were both dead. But you breathed when we pried {{Wolfar}}'s hands off your neck, and {{ he(Wolfar) }}’ll never breathe again—you’re stronger than I gave you credit for, captain.”
{{Gerin}} sat up, rubbing {{ hisd(Gerin) }} bruised throat. Looking at {{Schild}}, {{ he(Gerin) }} managed a thin whisper. “You knew {{Wolfar}} was tricking me with {{ hisd(Wolfar) }} talk of a keep {{ he(Wolfar) }} could go home to, and you helped {{ him(Wolfar) }} do it.”
Van barked a startled oath, but {{Schild}} only nodded. “Of course I did. {{ He(Wolfar) }} was my overlord; {{ he(Wolfar) }} always treated me fairly, harsh though {{ he(Wolfar) }} was. {{ He(Wolfar }} was not altogether wrong, either—it’s long past time for us to break away from the Empire’s worthless rule, and I cannot blame {{ him(Wolfar) }} for wanting the power {{ he(Wolfar) }} saw here for the taking.”
{{Schild}} looked {{Gerin}} in the eye. “I would not have called you ‘my {{ lord(Gerin) }},’ though, did I not think you would do a better job with it.” Slowly and deliberately, {{ he(Schild) }} went to one knee before the Fox. Van followed, though {{ hisd(Van) }} grin showed how little {{ he(Van) }} thought of such ceremonies.
Dazed more ways than one, {{Gerin}} accepted their homage. {{ He(Gerin) }} half-wished {{ he(Gerin) }} could flee instead. All {{ he(Gerin) }}’d ever wanted, {{ he(Gerin) }} told {{ himself(Gerin) }}, was to read and think and not be bothered. But when the responsibility for Castle Fox fell on {{ him(Gerin) }}, {{ he(Gerin) }} had not shirked it. No more could {{ he(Gerin) }} evade this greater one now.
{{ He(Gerin) }} looked at {{ hisd(Gerin) }} books, wondering when {{ he(Gerin) }} would find time to open them again. So much to be done: the Trokmoi ousted, keeps restored and manned, {{Elise}} wed (a solitary bright thought among the burdens), {{Duin}}’s stirrups investigated (which reminded {{ him(Gerin) }} how few horses {{ he(Gerin) }} had left), peasants brought back to the land … {{Dyaus}} above, where was there an unravaged crop within five days’ journey?
{{ He(Gerin) }} climbed to {{ his(Gerin) }} feet and walked toward the stairs. “Well,” {{ he(Gerin) }} said hoarsely, “let’s get to work.
