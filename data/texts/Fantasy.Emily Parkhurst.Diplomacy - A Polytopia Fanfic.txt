<h1>Diplomacy - A Polytopia Fanfic</h1>
<h3>by Emily Parkhurst</h3>

<h2>Chapter 1: An Audience</h2>
Polan'il forced {{ herself(Polan'il) }} to be icy calm. The throne room was too warm. Every eye was on {{ her(Polan'il) }}.
The Elyrion {{ Emperor }}'s voice chided, “a π∑a#∑ Ŧr∑aŦỹ? ~ţaŦ ŋȱŋ^∑ŋ^∑. ~ţỹ ^ţȱ₺∫Δ ~∑ Ŧr₺^Ŧ ỹȱ₺? Ŋȱ Ŧrio∑ ţa^ ∑‡∑r a∫∫i∑Δ o∑₼ȱr∑.”
This translated to, “A Peace Treaty? What nonsense. Why should we trust you? No tribe has ever allied before.”
The {{ Emperor }} was wise not to trust {{ her(Polan'il) }}. {{Polan'il}} had a cloak and dagger mission.
{{Polan'il}} replied in the Elyrion language, “Your Majesty, just because it hasn’t been done before doesn’t mean it wouldn’t work.”
{{Polan'il}} scanned the throne room. Courtiers in bright colors stood in front of tapestries depicting frolicking unicorns and fierce dragons. Pastel light filtered in through stained glass windows. Four royal warriors clad in pink ceremonial robes flanked the throne. Two more stood by the main entrance. There were three exits: the main double doors, a carved oak door, and a plain back door. There was also a fourth way out if {{ she(Polan'il) }} counted the balcony. A servant exited through the plain wooden door. From the aroma of baking that wafted out, the passage probably led to the kitchens. 
{{ She(Polan'il) }} didn’t stand a chance in a fight. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} best option was to convince the {{ Emperor }} to agree to a peace treaty. If things went badly, {{ she(Polan'il) }} could flee through the kitchen. {{ She(Polan'il) }}’d made it out of tighter spots before. 
“I don’t like war,” the {{ Emperor }} said, “I like pretty things, nature, color, light.”
Polan'il turned {{ herd(Polan'il) }} attention back to the ancient Elyrion leader. Wrinkles lined {{ hisd(Emperor) }} brow and the corners of {{ hisd(Emperor) }} gray eyes. {{ He(Emperor) }} had elbow-length, white hair, threaded with traces of blue, worn in long twists and crowned with a gold circlet. Like most people in the Elyrion tribe, {{ he(Emperor) }} had a triangular face, with a cleft chin, a narrow nose, and long pointed ears. Leaning backward and toying with the hem of {{hisd(Emperor}} robe, the {{Emperor}} had a distracted feel about {{ him(Emperor) }}.
“Your Majesty, we already have an embassy here. If we agree to a treaty, the revenues…“
“Do you have an embassy with Cymanti?” the ruler interrupted.
{{Polan'il}} caught {{ herself(Polan'il) }} frowning and smoothed {{ herd(Polan'il) }} features. “Of course not, your Majesty. We are at war with Cymanti. The same as you.”
The {{ Emperor }} shook {{ hisd(Emperor) }} head, like a defiant child. “We are not at war with Cymanti. They are at war with us. They started it.“
{{Polan'il}} put on {{ herd(Polan'il) }} best deferential face. {{ She(Polan'il) }} needed to persuade, not to fight. “Your Majesty, the Cymanti menace is a common threat to both our peoples, Polaris and Elyrion. Yes, your tribe has a strong economy, impressive technology, lovely parks, and beautiful cities, but you have no army. You need military support.” 
The {{ Emperor }} waved a dismissive hand, “We are doing fine.”
The courtiers in the throne room tittered in response, their gossip rolling through the room like a wave. Some pointed and shook their heads. 
Ice and Ashes. How {{Polan'il}} hated this part of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} job. {{ She(Polan'il) }} resisted the urge to pull {{ herd(Polan'il) }} furred hood over {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head and hide. 
The {{ Emperor }} shifted in {{ hisd(Emperor) }} throne and looked away, {{ hisd(Emperor) }} gaze looking out past the balcony. Defiance sparked in {{ hisd(Emperor) }} old eyes. “And what’s to stop you from betraying us? I bet you’d love to hunt our sweet animals and chop our lovely trees.”
One of the warriors flanking the {{ Emperor }} shifted, {{ herd(Eren) }} eyes narrowing on {{Polan'il}}. Something about the way the warrior assessed {{Polan'il}} reminded {{ her(Polan'il) }} of {{Eren}}, like {{ she(Eren) }} was both entertained and eager, like {{ she(Eren) }} wanted to eat {{Polan'il}} alive. 
No. {{ She(Polan'il) }} could not think of {{Eren}}. Not now.
{{Polan'il}} tried again. “The benefits of peace outweigh the risks of betrayal. Think of the opportunities. Increased trade, freedom to travel, and exchange of ideas and information.” The {{ Emperor }} was still frowning, so {{ she(Polan'il) }} took a risk and added, “Surely, we would both prefer peace to the alternative.” 
It wasn’t an empty threat. The {{ Emperor }} didn’t know if, but Polaris had agents stationed in their embassy as well as outside the city, ready to attack if things went poorly here. The Polaris forces probably couldn’t conquer the capital, but sabotage would seriously cripple them.
{{Polan'il}}’s words hit {{ herd(Polan'il) }} target, if a bit too forcefully. 
The {{ Emperor }} stood up, {{ hisd(Emperor) }} long blue-white hair rolling down {{ hisd(Emperor) }} chest. “Excuse me? I am the Seventh Scion of the Sovereign Sign, the Dragon Dreamer, the Ruler of all Imperial Elyrion. I have ruled the forests, the ocean, and the mountains since the First Hatching. I don’t like you and see no reason to trust you.” {{ He(Emperor) }} crossed {{ hisd(Emperor) }} arms and sat back down.
{{Polan'il}} felt {{ herd(Polan'il) }} face flush. {{ She(Polan'il) }} took a deep breath to steady {{ herd(Polan'il) }} nerves. This was going poorly. The {{ Emperor }} might be old, but {{ he(Emperor) }} was acting like a child. The embassy was counting on {{Polan'il}} to deliver an alliance. No, all of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} tribe was counting {{ her(Polan'il) }}. Since rational arguments hadn’t worked, {{ she(Polan'il) }} would switch to flattery. 
{{ She(Polan'il) }} bowed low, humbling {{ herself(Polan'il) }}. “Your Majesty, I would not be here today if Polaris did not have sincere wishes to ally with your glorious empire. Yes, our tribe would get more out of the alliance than you would, but our two peoples need to band together if we are to survive.”
The {{ Emperor }} let out a bored sigh. “I have heard enough. Elyrion is better off on our own. You can keep your embassy here, but I won’t ally with your tribe.” {{ He(Emperor) }} waved {{ her(Polan'il) }} away, “You are dismissed.”
{{ She(Polan'il) }} could see the arrogance in the leader’s eyes. Logical arguments, flattery, and threats had not been enough. What else could {{ she(Polan'il) }} do? What would {{Eren}} say if {{ she(Eren) }} were here? Probably flirt or make a joke, something about breaking the ice. But {{Polan'il}} wasn’t sassy or charming like {{Eren}} and {{Polan'il}} had to stop thinking of {{ her(Eren) }}. 
Frustration spilled out of {{Polan'il}}. “You think Elyrion is strong, but it is weak. You sit in your beautiful castle, drinking elderberry wine and gazing at rainbows, while your people fume. Mark my words, if you do not ally with Polaris to fight Cymanti, your people will turn against you. It won’t be the bugs that defeat you, but your own pride.” 
The {{ Emperor }} scowled, “How dare you!”
The warriors stepped forward, hands going to their weapons. 
{{Polan'il}} took a step back. {{ She(Polan'il) }} glanced at the kitchen door, ready to flee. 
Time seemed to slow.
The double doors to the hall burst open and a familiar rich voice called out, “{{Polan'il}}, my dear! How good to see you.”
<h2>Chapter 2: {{Eren}}</h2>
{{Polan'il}} spun around to see an Elyrion {{ woman(Eren) }} bounding towards {{ her(Polan'il) }}, blue hair flying, arms outstretched, ample curves flowing like water in a stream.
{{Eren}} embraced {{ her(Polan'il) }}, the smells of honeysuckle and sage, wafting over {{Polan'il}}. {{ She(Eren) }} smelled the same, after so many years.
The large {{ woman(Eren) }} pulled back, {{ herd(Eren) }} face shining with excitement. “{{Polan'il}}! Why didn’t you tell me you were in the city? Sparks! We have so much to catch up on. And we need to take you shopping.” {{ Herd(Eren) }} face dropped in mock horror, then laughed.. “What are you wearing, a dead animal?” 
{{Polan'il}}’s mind was frozen, unable to think of anything other than {{Eren}}, {{ herd(Eren) }} smell, {{ herdEren) }} closeness, {{ herd(Eren) }} frenzied energy.
{{Eren}} bowed low to the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}, “Your Majesty, may I offer my assistance?” 
The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} frowned in confusion, “{{ Damee(Eren) }} {{Eren}}, do you know this Polaris diplomat?”
{{ Damee(Eren) }} {{Eren}}? That was new. When had {{Eren}} gained a title? The last time {{Polan'il}} had seen {{ her(Eren) }} {{ she(Eren) }} was just a squire.
“Know {{ her(Polan'il) }}? I adore {{ her(Polan'il) }}. {{Polan'il}} and I were once very close.” {{Eren}} winked and repeated, “Very close.”
{{Polan'il}} felt the heat rise to {{ herd(Polan'il) }} face. {{ Her(Polan'il) }} mind whirled. More than ever, {{Polan'il}} wanted to disappear. This is exactly why {{ she(Polan'il) }} didn’t hadn’t sought out {{Eren}}. The {{ woman(Eren) }} scrambled {{Polan'il}}’s brain and made it impossible for {{ her(Polan'il) }} to concentrate.
{{Polan'il}} forced {{ herself(Polan'il) }} to focus on {{ herd(Polan'il) }} mission. All was not lost. Maybe {{Eren}} could persuade the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} to listen to help.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} took a deep breath and forced a jovial smile. “Well met, {{Eren}}. So good to see you again. I came from the embassy. On behalf of the Polaris tribe, I offer the Elyrion tribe a formal peace treaty. What do you think?”
{{Polan'il}} pressed {{ herd(Polan'il) }} lips together and looked into {{Eren}}’s eyes, those deep green eyes that shone with confidence. How many times had {{ she(Polan'il) }} stared into this {{ woman(Eren) }}’s beautiful eyes?
The gaiety faded from {{Eren}}’s face for a moment, revealing the worry underneath. {{Eren}} searched {{Polan'il}}s face, the unspoken questions held back. Then, {{Eren}} smiled, a small, kind, smile that one saved for naughty children or dogs covered in mud. 
The knight took one of {{Polan'il}}’s hands in {{ herd(Eren) }} own. “What a splendid idea.” {{ She(Eren) }} turned to the throne and stood up a bit straighter., “Sire, {{Polan'il}} is one of the smartest people I know. You should listen to {{ her(Eren) }}. {{ She(Eren) }} may not know how to dress in anything other than mangy furs and seal skin, but {{ she(Eren) }} has a keen mind.”
“And you trust {{ her(Eren) }}?” the {{ Emperor}} leaned forward.
“Completely.”
{{Polan'il}} held {{ herd(Polan'il) }} breath and {{Eren}}’s hand.
The {{ Emperor }} blew out a breath and tsked. “Fine. I’ll think about a peace treaty but I want {{ Damee(Eren) }} {{Eren}} and my military people there to help negotiate. Come back tomorrow.”

<h2>Chapter 3: Embassy</h2>
{{Polan'il}} didn’t dare speak. {{ She(Polan'il) }} bowed, dropped {{Eren}}’s hand, and fled the throne room. {{ She(Polan'il) }} didn’t know which {{ she(Polan'il) }} was more scared of, the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}’s fickle mood, being the center of attention, or {{Eren}}’s nearness. All {{ she(Polan'il) }} knew is that {{ she(Polan'il) }} had to get away and hide, at least for a little bit. {{ She(Polan'il) }} threw {{ herd(Polan'il) }} hood over {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head, then made for the embassy.
The bustling Elyrion capital was nothing like the icy calm of Polaris. Smells of manure, charcoal, and baking dominated the streets. The capital was built at the edge of an ancient oak forest, with stone towers as majestic and proud as the surrounding trees. The city stood out against a backdrop of gentle mountains, whose resources had helped grow the city to the size it was today. The materials the mountains had provided were crucial for constructing the city, but they were also influential when it came to architectural designs as the vast majority of buildings were rounded and graceful, mimicking the worn stone and long curves of the mountains.
The skyline was packed with towers topped with white stone parapets or blue tile roofs. The buildings seemed to be continuously evolving as new additions were added. Even now, scaffolding stretched across most of the streets, making the crowd feel even thicker. Parks and gardens flourished in every corner of the capital; even the palace boasted a lush rooftop park.
Unlike Polaris, where different tribes had left their mark, the city's identity was firmly Elyrion. In the street, {{Polan'il}}’s furred hood, beige coat, and dark eyes, stood out against a multicolored quilt of Elyrion subjects dressed in garish fabrics and sporting bright blue hair. Cafes and tea houses offered ample choices for people to gather, gossip, and gobble up. {{Polan'il}} could spend hours sitting in the back of one of those cafes, silently observing people, taking notes, tracking patterns. The delicate aromas of baked goods mingled with the sounds of laughter.
Finally, {{Polan'il}} reached the Polaris embassy. It wasn’t even an entire building, just the top floor of a large tower which housed a public library and the municipal court.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} climbed the stairs to the entryway of the Embassy. A cool hush settled over {{ her(Polan'il) }} as {{ she(Polan'il) }} closed the doors. Slim braziers hung from six white stone columns carved with geometric patterns. A mosaic made of polished stone depicting the Birthing Blizzard covered the floor.  Although it was all in plain sight, if you knew the secret code, a spy could decipher the symbols too.
Embassy staff rushed to greet {{ her(Polan'il) }}, their gloved hands pressed together briefly as a sign of respect. 
A stocky {{ woman(Anpolta) }} with round face and sharp eyes called out in Polarisi, “Blessed be the Gaami! {{Polan'il}}, you’re back already?” 
In the embassy, they always spoke Polarisi. 
“Yes, Ambassador {{Anpolta}},” {{Polan'il}} steepled {{ herd(Polan'il) }} fingers in greeting. {{ She(Polan'il) }} gave the standard reply, “Blessed Be,” then continued, “You are looking well for someone who was green yesterday.  If I’d known you’d recovered, I would have asked you to come with me.”
{{Anpolta}} nodded and patted {{ herd(Anpolta) }} ample belly, “That Cymanti poison can’t keep me down for long. A few days rest and I’m as splendid as snow. But tell me, did you get us a peace treaty?”
“Not yet, but I got frost on the pond, so to speak.”
“Come, give me a full report. Everyone else, back to work.” {{Anpolta}} led {{Polan'il}} by the arm to the map room. The rest of the staff turned and drifted away.
The map room smelled of parchment and charcoal. A large table in the middle of the room was scattered with scrolls and ledgers. Maps of the different regions were tacked to boards on the walls, marked with lines showing the movement of troops and trade between the tribes. This was the nerve center of the embassy, where the ambassador planned and coordinated.
{{Anpolta}} put both gloved hands on the table and leaned towards {{Polan'il}}, hungry for news. “So, what happened?”

<h2>Chapter 4: Report</h2>
{{Polan'il}} took a deep breath, “As our reports indicated, the {{ Emperor }} is proud and pampered. {{ Hisd(Emperor) }} fixation on nature and frippery blind {{ him(Emperor) }} to the military situation. I tried everything to get {{ him(Emperor) }} to agree to the peace treaty - logic, flattery, threats - nothing worked.”
“But you said peace still has a chance?” {{Anpolta}} frowned, like a student trying to figure out a complicated math equation.
“An old friend of mine showed up unexpectedly, {{ Damee(Eren) }} {{Eren}}. {{ She(Eren) }} spoke up in favor of the treaty and {{ he(Emperor) }} listened to {{ her(Eren) }}.”
“So, this {{ Damee(Eren) }} {{Eren}} is someone the {{ Emperor }} trusts. What about you? Do you trust {{ her(Eren) }}? How do you know {{ her(Eren) }}?” {{Anpolta}} crossed {{ herd(Anpolta) }} arms, peering at {{Polan'il}}.
{{Polan'il}} paused, weighing how much to reveal. “We had an intimate relationship years ago. We were both quite young and it ended abruptly.”
{{Anpolta}} threw up {{ herd(Anpolta) }} arms and smiled, “Haha. A former lover. Excellent. This could be very useful to us. You should strike up the relationship again. Having that kind of access to the {{ Emperor}}’s inner circle could be very useful to us.”
{{Polan'il}} swallowed hard, shaking {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head, pushing away the memories of {{ her(Polan'il) }} and {{Eren}} tangled together. “Ambassador, I don’t think that’s a good idea. {{Eren}} is unpredictable and no, I don’t trust {{ her(Eren) }}.”
{{Anpolta}}’s studious frown was back. {{ She(Anpolta) }} shook {{ herd(Anpolta) }} head. “My icy ass. {{Polan'il}}, are you letting your personal feelings interfere with your job? You’re a spy not a suitor.”
{{Polan'il}} looked down. “Yes, {{ Ma-am(Anpolta) }}.” 
“Use your relationship with {{Eren}} to your advantage. Understand?”
{{Polan'il}}d needed to get this conversation back on track. “The {{ Emperor }} said I should come back tomorrow and discuss the details of the treaty with {{ hisd(Emperor) }} advisors. Are you well enough to meet with them? I could use your expertise.”
“Yes, yes. Like I said, splendid as snow.”
“Good.” {{Polan'il}} started to pace around the table. “We need to do two things, make the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} trust us and persuade {{ him(Emperor) }} of the benefits of a treaty. I think we should focus on how our alliance can protect the Elyrion lands and natural resources. The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} was more concerned about what the Cymanti might do to {{ hisd(Emperor) }} forests than {{ hisd(Emperor) }} cities.”
{{Anpolta}} mused, “By all our reports, the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} seems like an intelligent leader. {{ He(Emperor) }} has an incredible system of wild animal sanctuaries and temples. It makes you wonder why {{ he(Emperor) }} has spent so much of the tribe’s resources on city beautification and nature conservation. With {{ hisd(Emperor) }} long range planning skills, {{ he(Emperor) }} would have made a good military commander.”
“The Elyrion must have more military than we are aware of. I’ll talk to {{Eren}}, apparently {{ she(Eren) }}’s a knight now. Maybe I can get {{ her(Eren) }} to tell me about {{ herd(Eren) }} training and how many other Elyrion knights there are.”
{{Anpolta}} stood up straight. “Good, good. We need this treaty but also we need all the information we can get about the Elyrion army. If things go badly, …” {{Anpolta}} trailed off, {{ herd(Anpolta) }} usual energy fading.
“{{ Ma-am(Anpolta) }}? Are you feeling alright? Is it the poison?”
{{Anpolta}} shook {{ herd(Anpolta) }} head, “I feel fine. It’s just that…” {{Anpolta}} paused and closed {{ herd(Anpolta) }} eyes, doubt clouding {{ herd(Anpolta) }} face. “I have family in a border city, on the border with Cymanti. I worry for them. I will do whatever it takes to keep them safe.” 
{{Polan'il}} didn’t know what to say. {{ She(Polan'il) }} could see the strain on {{Anpolta}}’s face. {{ She(Polan'il) }} hadn’t expected this display of emotion from {{ herd(Polan'il) }} superior. Should {{ she(Polan'il) }} try to comfort {{ her(Anpolta) }}? Ask about {{ herd(Anpolta) }} family? Share {{ herd(Polan'il) }} own doubts? {{Polan'il}} decided to play it safe and opted for respectful silence.
{{Anpolta}} looked down at the floor. The silence stretched out. {{Polan'il}} heard the scuffed sounds of embassy staff in the next room. {{Anpolta}}’s attention flicked to a crate on the corner.
{{Anpolta}} took a deep breath, optimistic once again. “Ah, some new gear came from the capital. Special cloaks for our special operatives.” {{Anpolta}} reached for a bundle of fabric and handed it to {{Polan'il}}.  
“A cloak?” {{Polan'il}} took the hooded garment. On the outside, it looked much like a standard beige parka, but the dark fabric that lined the inside of the cloak was not furred, but glossy black, almost slippery. The lantern light seemed to slide away from it.
“Not just any cloak,” {{Anpolta}} answered. {{ She(Anpolta) }} took the clothing from {{Polan'il}}, twirled it around,and settled it over {{ herd(Anpolta) }} head and shoulders. 
{{Polan'il}} gasped. 
{{Anpolta}} had disappeared.
“What? How?” {{Polan'il}} sputtered.
{{Anpolta}} reappeared again, slipping the cloak from {{ herd(Anpolta) }} shoulders. The ambassador explained, “This cloak is reversible. On the one side, you see ordinary hide, the same as any other Polaris garb. However, the lining on the inside has magical properties which make it nearly impossible to be seen. Wearing that side, the only way you can be detected is if someone bumps into you.” {{Anpolta}} held the cloak out. “Use it only when absolutely necessary.”
{{Polan'il}} took the garment, running {{ herd(Polan'il) }} fingers over the silky inner lining. “Yes. Thank you.”
“Very good.” {{Anpolta}} nodded and straightened. “I want a full written report of your meeting with the {{ Emperor }} by the end of the day. I’ll have the clerk send copies to the capital and our other outposts.”
“Yes, {{ Ma-am(Anpolta) }},” {{Polan'il}} said, setting the cloak down and reaching for a piece of parchment and a quill.
As {{ she(Polan'il) }} wrote {{ herd(Polan'il) }} report, {{ she(Polan'il) }} was filled with cautious optimism. With {{Anpolta}} at the meeting tomorrow, there was a good chance they could get the Peace Treaty finalized. But how much could {{ she(Polan'il) }} get involved with {{Eren}}? 
{{Anpolta}} was right, {{Polan'il}}’s connection with {{Eren}} could be used to Polaris’s advantage. Then again, maybe {{Eren}} would use {{Polan'il}} to Elyrion’s advantage. It wasn’t so much that {{Polan'il}} didn’t trust {{Eren}}. It was that {{Polan'il}} didn’t trust {{ herself(Polan'il) }} when {{Eren}} was involved. {{ She(Polan'il) }} worried {{ herd(Polan'il) }} feelings would cloud {{ herd(Polan'il) }} judgment.
{{Polan'il}} sighed and started to write {{ herd(Polan'il) }} report. {{ She(Polan'il) }} would do {{ herd(Polan'il) }} job as best {{ she(Polan'il) }} could, but leave {{Eren}} out of it. That was the safest plan.
<h2>Chapter 5: Library</h2>
{{Polan'il}} leaned against a bookshelf in the musty royal library. There was only one way in and out, the carved wooden door nestled between imposing bookshelves, and it made {{ her(Polan'il) }} nervous to have no other escape routes. Like all the other rooms in the castle, it was too warm. A bright fire danced in the marble hearth. 
The {{ Emperor }} was huddled around a large desk with some Elyrion advisors and Ambassador {{Anpolta}}. One of the Elyrion nobles, a lanky knight named {{ Sirr(Conner) }} {{Conner}}, was outspoken against any agreement. {{ He(Conner) }} mumbled things like, “Can’t trust those icy foreigners,” and “better off on our own than with those mammoth-loving morons.”
{{Eren}} was there too, speaking up for peace. {{ She(Eren) }} followed {{Polan'il}}’s lead, agreeing that peace was the best way to preserve the natural state of the lands. The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} vacillated between distracted boredom and paying attention to what {{Eren}} said.
Every now and then {{Eren}} would glance at {{Polan'il}} and wink. {{Polan'il}} wasn’t sure what made {{ her(Polan'il) }} more uncomfortable, the uneasy peace treaty, the heat of the room, or the way {{Eren}} kept eyeing {{ her(Polan'il) }} salaciously. 
A servant in a pink apron set down a tray of tea and cakes iced in rainbow colors.
{{Eren}} left the negotiating table and stood next to {{Polan'il}}, eyeing {{ her(Polan'il) }} up and down. “Why are you still wearing that ugly fur coat? You don’t need that horrid display of arctic barbarism in here.” 
{{Eren}} wore a rich brocade of salmon silk, embroidered with green trees and yellow roses. {{ Herd(Eren) }} hair was braided into a crown of blue waves. The knight sank down into an upholstered chair by the fire and patted the chair opposite {{Polan'il}}. “Relax a little. Have some tea.”
The talks with the {{ Emperor }} had stretched all day and into the evening, hammering out the details of the treaty - shared roads, safe passage for troops, trade routes, even new sources of revenue.
“No, thank you,” {{Polan'il}} answered, staying at {{ herd(Polan'il) }} spot near the bookshelf. {{Polan'il}} was exhausted, but {{ she(Polan'il) }} couldn’t let it show. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had to keep {{ herd(Polan'il) }} composure, and above all, not let {{Eren}} distract {{ her(Polan'il) }}.
The {{ Emperor }} stepped back from the desk and stifled a yawn. “Enough already. The treaty is fine.”  
{{Anpolta}} bowed and said, “Very good, your Majesty. I foresee a bright future between our two tribes.”
{{Eren}} let out a whoop of excitement. “Color the sky! This is a wonderful thing for our two peoples.” {{ She(Eren) }} paused and added, “Oh! Let’s do a signing ceremony in the Palace courtyard in a few days. We can decorate the yard with banners, maybe get some entertainers….”
{{ Sirr(Conner) }} {{Conner}} interrupted, “For the maximum benefit, Elyrion should also send a delegation to establish an embassy in the Polaris capital as soon as possible. We need an exchange of information and resources.” 
The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} made a dismissive gesture, batting at the air. “Yes, yes. You sort it out. I’m tired.” {{ He(Emperor) }} left the library and {{ hisd(Emperor) }} advisors trailed after {{ him(Emperor) }}, like a line of seal cubs following their{{ mother(Emperor) }}. 
{{Polan'il}} started to leave when {{ she(Polan'il) }} felt a hand on {{ herd(Polan'il) }} arm. “Stay a moment,” {{Eren}} purred. 
{{Polan'il}} felt {{ herd(Polan'il) }} breath catch. {{ She(Polan'il) }} turned backwards, into {{Eren}}’s hungry gaze. Despite the heat, {{Polan'il}} crossed {{ herd(Polan'il) }} arms, pulling {{ herd(Polan'il) }} coat tighter. {{Polan'il}} looked to {{Anpolta}} for help, “Sorry, I can’t stay. We need to get back to the embassy. There is so much to prepare for.”
{{Anpolta}} glanced at {{Eren}}, smirked, then looked back at {{Polan'il}}, “You’ve done enough work today. We all have. Take the rest of the night off. I’ll see you at the embassy tomorrow.”
Of course, {{Anpolta}} meant the exact opposite of what {{ herd(Anpolta) }} words said. {{Polan'il}} knew {{Anpolta}} wanted {{ her(Polan'il) }} to stay and spy, which meant getting reacquainted with {{Eren}}. 
{{Polan'il}} nodded, “Thank you, Ambassador. Until tomorrow.”
{{Anpolta}} turned and left the library. 
All that remained in the room was {{Eren}}, {{Polan'il}}, and the overly hot fire. {{Polan'il}} didn’t have a plan for dealing with {{Eren}}. {{ She(Polan'il) }} should have made a plan, but {{ she(Polan'il) }} also didn’t dare let {{ herself(Polan'il) }} think about {{Eren}} too much. Now what?
{{Polan'il}} forced {{ herself(Polan'il) }} to smile, “You look well, {{Eren}}. How have you been? ”
Instead of answering, {{Eren}} reached for one of the iced cakes, then poured {{ herself(Eren) }} some tea. “You owe me, {{Polan'il}}.”  {{Eren}}’s tone made it clear {{ she(Eren) }} was not interested in banal small talk.
{{Polan'il}}’s mind retreated to the memory of the last time {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d seen {{Eren}}. It had been a humid summer day on the shores of the lake. The two had gone swimming and laid together on the shore, oversized blossoms filling the air with a heady fragrance, bare skin against bare skin.
“You’re right,” {{Polan'il}} sighed. “I’m sorry, how I left you in the city. I got an urgent missive from the capital. I couldn’t stay. I should’ve left a note…” {{ She(Polan'il) }} trailed off, unable to finish the lie. 
There had been no summons. Only {{ herd(Polan'il) }} fear of getting too close. Better to end the relationship early, give a shallow cut rather than stay and deliver a fatal blow once {{ she(Polan'il) }} was in too deep. 
{{Eren}} shook {{ herd(Eren) }} head, “Not that, you lout. I’m talking about how I saved your too tight ass in the throne room yesterday. What were you thinking talking to the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} like that? If I hadn’t shown up when I did, you’d be skewered.” {{ She(Eren) }} paused and smirked, “Although, I do like to see your ass get skewered.”
{{Polan'il}} grimaced, “Really? In the royal library? Your lewdness knows no bounds.”
{{Eren}} bowed slightly, “Thank you. I strive for excellence.”
{{Polan'il}} rolled {{ herd(Polan'il) }} eyes. “Besides, I had everything under control.” {{Polan'il}}’s stomach rumbled. {{ She(Polan'il) }} resisted the urge to grab one of the pastries. 
“Hah. You haven’t changed a bit, {{Polan'il}}. You imagine that everything is going according to plan, your plan. Same old {{Polan'il}}. Always under control.” {{Eren}} shook {{ herd(Eren) }} head, blue tresses gently waving. “You could just say, ‘thank you.’”
{{Polan'il}} took a step closer, {{ herd(Polan'il) }} temper flaring, just like the fire in the hearth. “And you always need to be the center of attention. It’s always about you.”
“Me? I just like to have fun. Open up for once. Live a little. Don’t hide behind that icy wall of pride.”
This was not going well. {{Polan'il}} remembered what {{Anpolta}} said. How could {{ she(Polan'il) }} use {{ herd(Polan'il) }} history with {{Eren}} to get information on Elyrion? {{Polan'il}} took a deep breath, steadied {{ herd(Polan'il) }} nerves, and tried again, “Who is {{Conner}}? Why doesn’t {{ he(Conner) }} like Polaris? Did you train with {{ him(Conner) }} to become a knight, or however that works?”
{{Eren}} took a bite of cake, chewed slowly, then stood to face {{Polan'il}}, a knowing smile on {{ herd(Eren) }} face. “You sound jealous, {{Polan'il}}. I didn’t expect that from you. I'm touched.”
{{Eren}} was so close. {{Polan'il}} could smell the elderberry in {{Eren}}’s hair. See the crumbs on the edge of {{Eren}}’s soft mouth. Feel the heat pulsing between them. It was too much.
{{Polan'il}} reached for {{Eren}}, hands sliding up {{ herd(Eren) }} neck, mouth crushing mouth. 
{{Eren}} tasted so good, like tea cakes and freedom. 
But something was wrong. {{Eren}} wasn’t responding. {{ She(Eren) }} was still, like ice over a lake. 
{{Polan'il}} froze. Ice and Ashes, what was {{ she(Polan'il) }} thinking?
{{Polan'il}} pulled away, {{ herd(Polan'il) }} breath ragged. “Forgive me. I should not have been so bold. The heat…”
Then {{Eren}} surged forward, reigniting the kiss and grabbing at {{ her(Polan'il) }}. {{Polan'il}} felt hands moving along {{ herd(Polan'il) }} shoulders and back, tugging at {{ herd(Polan'il) }} parka. 
Heat surged through {{Polan'il}}. {{ She(Polan'il) }} forgot everything - {{ herd(Polan'il) }} duty, {{ herd(Polan'il) }} mission, {{ herd(Polan'il) }} inhibitions. How {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d dreamed of this, night after night, {{Eren}}’s skin against {{ hers(Polan'il) }}. {{Polan'il}} lost {{ herself(Polan'il) }} in the delicious dip of {{Eren}}'s collar bone, the feel of {{Eren}}’s hands encircling {{ herd(Polan'il) }} neck, the press of {{Eren}}’s hips into {{ hers(Polan'il) }}. 
By the Maker, it felt so good.
There was a gasp from the door. {{Polan'il}} looked up. The servant who had brought the tea tray was back, {{ hisd(Servant1) }} eyes wide.
{{Eren}} turned to the door and said in a husky voice to the servant, “Come back later. We’re busy with … diplomatic intercourse.”
{{Polan'il}}’s sense of propriety slammed into {{ her(Polan'il) }} like an ice arrow, cooling {{ herd(Polan'il) }} passion and clearing {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head.
This was a mistake. {{Eren}} muddled {{Polan'il}}’s mind and made {{ her(Polan'il) }} too emotional to do {{ herd(Polan'il) }} job. {{Polan'il}} couldn’t do what {{Anpolta}} wanted. It was too risky. In {{Polan'il}}’s line of work, this kind of distraction and poor judgment could get people killed.
“No, I should get back to the embassy,” {{Polan'il}} mumbled, pulling {{ herd(Polan'il) }} fur coat back over {{ herd(Polan'il) }} shoulders.
“{{Polan'il}}, come on. Don’t be such a cold fish. Stay and have some fun. It won’t kill you.”
{{Polan'il}} shook {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head. “My apologies. The long day has made me careless. I have to go.”
{{Polan'il}} didn’t look back. {{ She(Polan'il) }} left the palace and headed for the Polaris embassy. In the palace courtyard, {{ she(Polan'il) }} was forced to traverse the weekly Flower Festival. Music and light swirled around dancing couples. Raucous youths in gaudy colors and floral crowns spilled out into the surrounding streets. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} mind drifted back to the warmth of the library, {{Eren}}’s mouth on {{ hers(Polan'il) }}, the smell of elderberry blossoms. {{ She(Polan'il) }} felt a tightness in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} throat and blinked away the tears. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had a job to do and {{ she(Polan'il) }} wouldn’t let {{Eren}} get in the way. {{Polan'il}} pushed past the throng of revelers, into the quiet dark.
Back in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} quarters at the Embassy, {{Polan'il}} washed in cold water, then got into bed. The chill water on {{ herd(Polan'il) }} skin sobered {{ her(Polan'il) }}. {{ She(Polan'il) }} made up {{ herd(Polan'il) }} mind. If {{Polan'il}} was careful, {{ she(Polan'il) }} could avoid {{Eren}} for the rest of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} time in the city. Once the treaty was signed, {{ she(Polan'il) }} would leave the city and never see {{Eren}} again.

<h2>Chapter 6: Treaty</h2>
Three days later, {{Polan'il}} stood with {{ Sirr(Conner) }} {{Conner}} on a dais in the courtyard of the castle. Colorful banners fluttered in the cool breeze. A blue-haired crowd was gathered, tittering and shuffling in anticipation of the signing ceremony. Since {{Anpolta}} had been called to a border dispute, {{Polan'il}} had been left to stand in for the Ambassador at the ceremony. The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} was seated on the balcony above, yawning. {{Conner}} held the official Elyrion seal in {{ hisd(Conner) }} hand, pressing it to the creamy parchment. {{Eren}} was there too, beside {{Conner}}.
“It is done!” {{ Sirr(Conner) }} {{Conner}} proclaimed. “The treaty between Elyrion and Polaris is in effect.”
The crowd clapped and cheered in response. 
{{Polan'il}} turned {{ herd(Polan'il) }} attention away from {{Conner}}. {{ She(Polan'il) }} scanned the castle walls again. {{ She(Polan'il) }} counted the Elyrion warriors spaced evenly along the parapets. No change in their numbers. The crowd was peaceful, no obvious threats there. There were several clear escape routes out of the castle, the front gates, the stables and the yard beyond, and the ornamental gardens. The garden walls weren’t so high {{ she(Polan'il) }} couldn’t scale them with a good running jump. But {{ she(Polan'il) }} hated being out in the open like this. It was always safer to have some cover nearby, or at least be able to put {{ herd(Polan'il) }} back to a wall. Even with {{ herd(Polan'il) }} delegation from the embassy and {{ herd(Polan'il) }} hidden daggers, {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d be no match for the Elyrion forces. Not that {{ she(Polan'il) }} expected the {{ Emperor }} to betray Polaris now, but you never knew. It was better to be prepared.
Once the applause stopped, {{Conner}} spoke again. “Trade will flourish. Knowledge will be exchanged. Resources will grow. Together, the sum of our two tribes' forces and resources will be greater than when we were apart. Today we embark on a new era of peace, prosperity and security.”
The crowd responded with applause that slowly faded. Clouds rolled across the sun, casting a shadow over the courtyard. The silence stretched out. {{Polan'il}} could see the crowd was growing restless. {{Polan'il}} twisted around to look up at the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}. {{ He(Emperor) }} was just sitting in a gilt chair, waiting. What was going on? 
Finally, {{Polan'il}} looked to {{Eren}}. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had been avoiding looking at the {{ woman(Eren) }} all day, a difficult feat for {{Polan'il}}. {{Eren}} was like a unicorn, bold, beautiful, and strong. {{ She(Eren) }} could mesmerize you without even trying.
{{Eren}} locked eyes on {{Polan'il}}, tilted {{ herd(Eren) }} head, and nodded to the crowd. What was {{Eren}} trying to tell {{ her(Polan'il) }}? 
Then {{Eren}} made a small gesture towards the table with the peace treaty. {{Polan'il}} shook {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head, not understanding what was going on. The crowd began to mumble disapprovingly.
Finally make another gesture, {{Eren}}’s thumb smacking against the flat of {{ herd(Eren) }} fingers, like a mouth opening and closing.
Understanding dawned on {{Polan'il}} like a lightning strike. {{ She(Polan'il) }} was supposed to say something.
{{Polan'il}} stood up straight, faced the crowd, and spoke in a loud voice, “Yes, Polaris is proud to have peace with Elyrion. This is …” {{ she(Polan'il) }} fumbled. {{ She(Polan'il) }} hated this kind of thing. {{Polan'il}} wanted to melt into the background, not have everyone looking at {{ her(Polan'il) }}.  And {{ she(Polan'il) }} hadn’t prepared to speak. If {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d known, {{ she(Polan'il) }} would have written some notes. 
{{Eren}} nodded encouragingly. {{Polan'il}} settled on repeating what {{Conner}} had said, “a new era prosperity for our peoples.''
The crowd responded with polite applause. 
{{Polan'il}} let out a sigh of relief. {{Anpolta}} was so much better at this type of thing. {{ She(Polan'il) }} couldn’t wait to get out of this city. Away from the attention, the pressure, the temptation.
The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} spoke from above. {{ He(Emperor) }} read from a paper, “To solidify and strengthen ties between our nations, I am sending {{ Damee(Eren) }} {{Eren}} to establish an Elyrion embassy in the Polaris capital. The Polaris diplomat {{Polan'il}} will accompany {{ her(Eren) }} to insure the success of the venture.”
{{Polan'il}} sucked in a breath. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had not anticipated this. Sure, {{ she(Polan'il) }} had expected Elyrion to build an embassy in the Polaris capital, but why with {{Eren}}? Why go with {{Polan'il}}? Was this {{Conner}}’s idea or {{Eren}}’s? No. {{Polan'il}} couldn’t spend any more time with {{Eren}}. It was too dangerous. {{Polan'il}} wanted to kick {{ herself(Polan'il) }}. {{ She(Polan'il) }} should have seen it coming, but wherever {{Eren}} was involved {{ herd(Polan'il) }} judgment was clouded, like a fog blocking the road. {{ She(Polan'il) }} hated this feeling, having no plan in place. Once again, all eyes were on {{ her(Polan'il) }}.
Finally, {{ she(Polan'il) }} responded, “Yes of course. Polaris welcomes an Elyrion embassy. It will benefit all of us.” {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} mind was spinning, {{ she(Polan'il) }} had to find a way to get away from {{Eren}}. {{ She(Polan'il) }}’d done it before and {{ she(Polan'il) }} could do it again. “I will travel with {{ Lady(Eren) }} {{Eren}} as far as I can, barring any other urgent duties that arise.”
{{Polan'il}} glanced at {{Eren}}. The {{ woman(Eren) }} had a knowing smirk. {{Polan'il}} realized {{ she(Polan'il) }} had been outmaneuvered. 
Clearly, {{Eren}} had {{ herd(Eren) }} own plans. 
<h2>Chapter 7: Bait and Switch</h2>
The midday sun was high overhead as {{Polan'il}} and {{Eren}} entered the oak glen. The thick oaks stood sentry over the lush grass and burbling stream. Snow-capped mountains loomed in the distance, the Elyrion capital a distant memory. {{Eren}} was humming a jaunty tune.
{{Eren}} had invited {{Polan'il}} to ride beside {{ her(Eren) }} on {{ her(Eren) }} unicorn mount and {{Polan'il}} had declined. It would be impossible for {{Polan'il}} to think about anything other than {{Eren}}’s body if the two of them were pressed together, bumping up and down with each unicorn step. So {{Polan'il}} had walked next to {{Eren}} on the Imperial road. It was slower than riding, but safer. 

{{Eren}} said, “Keep your eyes open for wild unicorns. This is a new sanctuary. There should be some popping up soon.”
{{Polan'il}} was less interested in wild animals and more in Elyrion’s army. “So, {{ Damee(Eren) }} {{Eren}}, how’d you become a knight? Was {{Conner}} with you?”
{{Eren}} leaned back in {{ herd(Eren) }} saddle but kept {{ herd(Eren) }} eyes on the road. “I got to be a knight the usual way. I started as a squire. I trained with a lance, polished a lot of armor, and learned how to recite the entire ballad of Busty Belinda while balancing a tankard of ale on my head.”
{{Polan'il}} smiled, “Singing and drinking. Sounds like a delightful initiation program. Almost as grueling as being brainwashed by a bug.”
“Nah, the knights are good sports. We are like family. It’s not like Cymanti where the Shaman forces a bug onto your brain.”
Then {{Eren}} began singing:
“What do you do when you see a Cymanti?
Bug on the brain and intelligence scanty
What do you do when you see a Cymanti?
Squash it with your boot.”
{{Polan'il}} needed to get the conversation back on track. {{ She(Polan'il) }} needed to know about the Elyrion army and its command structure. {{ She(Polan'il) }} said, “Sirr {{Conner}} seems to have a lot of sway with the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }}. Did {{ he(Conner) }} write that speech for {{ him(Emperor) }} to read from the balcony?”
{{Eren}} hummed another bar of the tune then turned in {{ herd(Eren) }} saddle to face {{Polan'il}}. “The {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} likes to delegate. {{Conner}} is a lap dog, yipping at the heels of power. Don’t worry about {{ him(Conner) }}.”
“{{Conner}} is a knight, like you? Or does {{ he(Conner) }} have more authority?”
“Listen to you. {{Conner}}, {{Conner}}, {{Conner}}. You can be so determined.”
{{Polan'il}} took the hint and changed the subject. “Says the {{ woman(Eren) }} who collected 86 different hair ribbons from every solstice festival {{ she(Eren) }} could drag me to.”
{{Eren}} grinned. “Yeah, I did that mostly to annoy you.”
{{Polan'il}} let out a huff. “Ice and Ashes. You’re kidding.“
{{Eren}} cracked a smile, “How else was I going to convince you to come to all those festivals with me? Admit it. You liked keeping me from buying too many frivolous hair accessories.”
{{Polan'il}} blushed and looked away. They were coming to a clearing. {{ She(Polan'il) }} took out {{ herd(Polan'il) }} compass checking their bearing.
“This looks like a perfect spot for a meal and some rest, don’t you think?” {{Polan'il}} asked, putting away {{ herd(Polan'il) }} compass. {{ She(Polan'il) }} didn’t wait for {{Eren}} to answer. {{ She(Polan'il) }} took off {{ herd(Polan'il) }} pack and sat down on a smooth rock. {{Polan'il}} didn’t know what {{Eren}} was planning, but {{ she(Polan'il) }} had a plan of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} own.
{{Eren}} frowned down from {{ herd(Eren) }} mount. “Here? But there is nothing around for miles. We should eat at a village. There’s a tavern down the road that serves lovely almond bread and vegetable stew, not to mention the millinery. There is a hat shop there that sells bonnets made entirely of quiqui feathers.”
“A detour to a village would slow us down and this is a nice spot.”
“What will we eat? And more importantly, drink? I’m feeling far too sober.” {{Eren}} was still on {{ herd(Eren) }} unicorn, {{ herd(Eren) }} lance resting upright in its hostler. {{ She(Eren) }} was dressed head to toe in pink - pink gloves, pink boots, even {{ herd(Eren) }} shield was pink. 
“I brought enough food for both of us, and something to drink. I know what you like.” {{Polan'il}} smiled, reaching into {{ herdPolan'il) }} pack and bringing out a small flask. {{Polan'il}} knew it would be easy to get {{Eren}} comfortably tipsy. Then {{Polan'il}} could slip away unnoticed. It would mean leaving {{ herd(Polan'il) }} pack and supplies behind, but {{ she(Polan'il) }} could buy more. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had considered waiting until nightfall, but the risk was too great that {{Polan'il}} would end up curled up in a bedroom with {{Eren}} and unable - or unwilling - to slip away. Besides, {{Polan'il}} had {{ herd(Polan'il) }} special cloak and {{ she(Polan'il) }} was itching to test it out.
{{Eren}} dismounted with a grin, “The world would be so much better if everyone had a little more to drink. Don’t you think so?” {{ She(Eren) }} paused and made an exaggerated face of concentration. Then {{ she(Eren) }} pointed a pink gloved finger in the air. “Colors! I have an idea. What if we sent the bugs wine instead of fighting them?  We could get them so inebriated they decide to enjoy their buggy life and live in peace.”
{{Polan'il}} shook {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head and smiled. “Peace with the bugs. Imagine that.”
As {{Polan'il}} unpacked the meal, {{ she(Polan'il) }} scanned {{ herd(Polan'il) }} surroundings again out of habit. Other than {{Eren}}’s mount grazing leisurely nearby, there were no unicorns in the sanctuary. The oak leaves danced in the soft breeze. A pair of jays twittered overhead. Then a patch of rosy pink caught {{ herd(Polan'il) }} eye beyond the shade of the oaks. 
Although {{Polan'il}} was used to seeing pink scattered across the Elyrion countryside, this particular shade of dusty rose wasn’t native to the area. 
{{Polan'il}} stood abruptly.
“What’s wrong?” {{Eren}} asked.
“I thought I saw something.” {{Polan'il}} approached the patch of matted plants in the shade. {{ She(Polan'il) }} sucked in a breath. 
Fungus. 
<h2>Chapter 8: Evasion</h2>
{{Polan'il}} couldn’t let {{Eren}} notice the fungus. It would ruin {{ herd(Polan'il) }} plan. {{ She(Polan'il) }} also didn't want the {{ woman(Eren) }} stumbling through the poisonous plant.
“It’s nothing,” {{Polan'il}} said, taking {{Eren}}’s arm and guiding {{ her(Eren) }} back to the sunny glen.  “Just the flash of a unicorn. Those colors are mesmerizing.”
{{Polan'il}} handed {{Eren}} the flask and took a bite of bread. {{ She(Polan'il) }} needed to distract {{Eren}}. “So what will be your first step to setting up the embassy in the capitol? Do you want to talk to the High Council or visit the Gaami shrine?”
{{Eren}} took a swig from the flask and shrugged. “I like to keep my options open. Most likely, I’ll visit the first hat shop I can find and buy a dozen hair ribbons” Then {{ she(Eren) }} paused, {{ herd(Eren) }} eyes narrowing, “Wait. Do you even have hat shops in Polars? Don’t you all just wear the same dead animal skins?” {{Eren}} still wore {{ herd(Eren) }} pink gloves.
{{Polan'il}} ignored the jab, swallowed a bite of bread, and asked. “Why are you still wearing your riding gloves?”
{{Eren}} flexed {{ herd(Eren) }} fingers, letting the bright pink dance in the sunlight. “These are my lucky gloves.”
“Lucky?” {{Polan'il}} peered at the gloves. They seemed normal, aside from being bright pink.
{{Eren}} took another drink from the flask. “I started wearing them as a page, when I began my apprenticeship as a knight. Through all my training and every battle. I’ve never died while I was wearing them.”
{{Polan'il}} started to reply, then saw the gleam in {{Eren}}’s eye. {{Polan'il}} couldn’t help but smile.
“{{Eren}}, you are quite a….” {{Polan'il}} paused searching for a diplomatic response, “unique person.”
“Pft, I bet you tell that to all the pretty {{ girls(Eren) }}.”
{{Polan'il}} didn’t know how to say there hadn’t been any other pretty {{ girls(Eren) }}, not since their day at the lake. {{ She(Polan'il) }} finished {{ herd(Polan'il) }} food, then stood and stretched. It was time to take {{ herd(Polan'il) }} exit. {{ She(Polan'il) }} was enjoying {{Eren}}’s company far too much.
{{Eren}} leaned back and stared up at the oak canopy, “{{Polan'il}}, do you think the peace treaty will last?” {{ Herd(Eren) }} tone was far too serious.
Instead of answering, {{Polan'il}} turned the question around, “Why do you ask? You don’t think it will?”
{{Eren}} looked {{Polan'il}} in the eyes, “I don’t know, that’s why I’m asking you. I’m asking because you are the smartest person.”
{{Polan'il}} felt the heat rising in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cheeks, “I’m not that smart.”
{{Eren}} smiled, “True. For someone very intelligent, you can be an idiot, but you are a thinker. You think everything through. You look at things from every angle, every pro and con. If anyone has thought through this peace treaty and how it’s going to play out, it’s you. So I want to know what you think.”
{{Polan'il}} sighed. {{ She(Polan'il) }} didn’t want to lie, but {{ she(Polan'il) }} couldn’t tell the whole truth either. “It’s not a question of if the treaty will be broken but when.” {{ She(Polan'il) }} was about to add “by whom” but left that unsaid.
{{Eren}} nodded, “I figured as much. Hopefully it will last long enough to get our embassy built. It will be nice to spend more time with you.”
{{Polan'il}} swallowed hard, {{ herd(Polan'il) }} pulse coming fast. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had to get away, now.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} made a show of looking around the glen, then up at the looming mountain in the distance. A cliff at the base of the mountain was not far away and as good an excuse as any other. “I’m going to climb that cliff. Have a look around. I thought I saw some Cymanti fungus, but I’m not sure. I want some vision of the area. Wait for me here, will you?”
“Cymanti? Here?” {{Eren}} stood, alarmed. “I’ll come with you.”
“Can you climb?” {{Polan'il}} asked, knowing very well {{Eren}} couldn’t. The Polaris spy reports of the Elyrion abilities had been very clear - roads, chivalry, farming - no climbing. Not that {{Polan'il}} could climb either, but {{Eren}} didn’t know that.
“I can climb up a tree, around a castle wall, and into a beautiful {{ woman(Polan'il) }}’s heart. Does that count?” {{Eren}} winked.
{{Polan'il}} swallowed hard. Why was this so difficult? {{ She(Polan'il) }}’d left {{Eren}} before, {{ she(Polan'il) }} could do it again. It was better this way. Really. 
Before {{ she(Polan'il) }} could change {{ herd(Polan'il) }} mind, {{Polan'il}} set off towards the mountain and the cliff. {{ She(Polan'il) }} called back, “Don’t do anything foolish while I’m gone.”
As soon as {{ she(Polan'il) }} was out of {{Eren}}’s sight, {{Polan'il}} took off {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak and turned it inside out. To {{Polan'il}}, the dark silky fabric had a glassy look, like polished obsidian or melting ice. {{ She(Polan'il) }} draped  the cloak over {{ herdPolan'il) }} shoulders, becoming invisible. There was no way {{Eren}} would find {{ her(Polan'il) }} now.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} stole away, in the opposite direction of the mountain, careful where {{ she(Polan'il) }} stepped. The still oaks loomed overhead, but the patches of fungus were getting thicker. A bad sign.
{{Polan'il}} ran {{ herd(Polan'il) }} plan through {{ herd(Polan'il) }} mind. It calmed {{ herd(Polan'il) }} nerves, ticking off each point in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head. First, set up a network of spies and agents inside Elyrion. Done. Second, establish a peace with Elyrion. Done. The next steps were to use Elyrion as a buffer between {{ herd(Polan'il) }} people and the Cymanti enemy. Lastly, {{ she(Polan'il) }} would keep tabs on the Elyrion military and send word to {{ herd(Polan'il) }} superiors to strike preemptively if needed.
{{Polan'il}} already had a strong network of Polaris spies and insurgents sewn into the fabric of Elyrion territory. If {{ she(Polan'il) }} gave the signal, they could come out of hiding, bringing their so-called ally down. Thankfully, the {{ Emperor(Emperor) }} had agreed to peace. It was better this way. The treaty would give Polaris time to build up an army while Elyrion took the brunt of the Cymanti attack. When the time was right, Polaris would break the peace with Elyrion, seize  their lands, consolidate power, and make the Square safe for {{ herd(Polan'il) }} people.
{{Polan'il}} pulled a compass out of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} pocket. {{ She(Polan'il) }} held it out, waiting for the needle to steady.
A noise made {{ her(Polan'il) }} freeze. A squeaky chittering sound, like a mouse chewing on glass. 
Cymanti.
No. {{Polan'il}} couldn't believe {{ herd(Polan'il) }} own ears. The fungus had been one thing but Cymanti soldiers? This deep into Elyrion territory. How? It was too soon.
The next moment, an insect the size of a horse crawled out from behind an oak. The hexapod’s six articulated legs flowed over the fungi, unaffected by the poison. 
{{Polan'il}}’s heart raced, dread flowing through {{ her(Polan'il) }}. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} hand holding the compass began to tremble, but {{ she(Polan'il) }} didn’t dare move. 
Could the  bug see {{ her(Polan'il) }}? Was {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak working?
The giant bug squeaked again and cocked its oversized head. Its antennae twitched. Was it communicating with others? It still made no move towards {{Polan'il}}. Even if the bug couldn’t see {{ her(Polan'il) }}, this was bad. 
Then another fear struck {{ her(Polan'il) }}. {{Eren}}. The knight was lounging at the sunny grove, eating cheese and drinking wine. {{ She(Eren) }}’d be attacked before {{ she(Eren) }} could reach {{ herd(Eren) }} mount.
This was {{Polan'il}}’s fault. {{ She(Polan'il) }} should have realized what the fungus meant. If anything happened to {{Eren}}… No. {{Polan'il}} couldn’t think of that. 

{{Polan'il}} stayed still. {{ She(Polan'il) }} didn’t dare move and {{ she(Polan'il) }} couldn’t attack. {{ She(Polan'il) }} was no match for the giant bug. 
{{ Herd(Polan'il) }} arm holding the compass grew heavy. There was nothing else to do but wait. {{ She(Polan'il) }} was no match for the bug’s sharp mandibles. The creature couldn’t see {{ her(Polan'il) }}. {{ She(Polan'il) }}’d be safe as long as the bug didn’t get any closer. Once it moved on, {{ she(Polan'il) }} could double back to {{Eren}}. Warn {{ herd(Polan'il) }} companion. Then, they could get help.
“{{Polan'il}}? Where are you?” {{Eren}} called from the sanctuary. 
{{Polan'il}}’s heart sank.
The hexapod skittered away, towards the shout. Towards {{Eren}}. 
{{Polan'il}} followed.
<h2>Chapter 9: Poison</h2>
{{Polan'il}} dashed through the forest, leaves scratching at {{ herd(Polan'il) }} face and tugging at {{ herd(Polan'il) }} clothes. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} cloak flapped around {{ herd(Polan'il) }}, the compass till tight in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} grasp. The Cymanti’s sounds ricocheted through the trees. {{Polan'il}} saw another hexapod and another. Thankfully, the creatures didn’t notice {{ her(Polan'il) }}. But the bugs were moving fast towards the sanctuary, towards {{Eren}}. 
{{Eren}}. By the Glorious Gaami, please be safe. Please.
Part of {{Polan'il}}’s mind knew {{ she(Polan'il) }} couldn’t outrun the bugs. Another part of {{ her(Polan'il) }} refused to leave {{Eren}} to battle the enemy alone. Yet another part marveled at the contradiction. Hadn’t {{ she(Polan'il) }} been willing to abandon {{Eren}} only moments ago? {{ She(Polan'il) }} shoved that questioning part of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} mind away. {{ She(Polan'il) }} didn’t have time to argue with {{ herself(Polan'il) }}.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} ran across a shallow stream, {{ herd(Polan'il) }} boots splashing through the water. {{ She(Polan'il) }} lost {{ herd(Polan'il) }} balance, slipping on a wet rock and nearly fell into a patch of fungus. {{ She(Polan'il) }} gasped. {{ She(Polan'il) }} whirled {{ herd(Polan'il) }} arms, steadying {{ herself(Polan'il) }}. 
A hexapod moved out from behind a tree, its antenna waving, tasting the air, searching. It was coming towards {{ her(Polan'il) }}. The bug must have heard {{ her(Polan'il) }}.
{{Polan'il}} took a step back into the stream. It was a mistake. The splash of the water caught the bug’s attention. It still couldn’t see {{ her(Polan'il) }}, but it could hear {{ herd(Polan'il) }} boots in the water.
The creature hissed and lunged forward. 
{{Polan'il}} crouched down and flung {{ herd(Polan'il) }} arms over {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head. {{ She(Polan'il) }} dropped the compass. {{ She(Polan'il) }} cursed inwardly and froze. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} only hope was to remain invisible.
A horse neighed in the distance. No, not a horse. A unicorn. 
The sound of hooves pounding on dirt made {{Polan'il}} look up.
A flash of white and brilliant pink streaked through the forest. {{Polan'il}} heard the crack of wood on bone, the screams of wild pain and surprise. 
Then {{Eren}} was there, splashing through the stream, {{ herd(Eren) }} lance pointed at the nearest hexapod. 
The sharp wood drove through the bug’s head, severing it from the abdomen, and sending a spurt of sickly green fluid into the air and fouling the stream.
{{Eren}} reared {{ herd(Eren) }} mount to a stop. The knight spat down on the dead bug. “Die you foul creature. How dare you defile the beauty of this sanctuary with your ugly faces and even uglier war.” 
Relief flowed through {{Polan'il}} like the water sliding over {{ herd(Polan'il) }} boots. {{Eren}} was safe. More than that. {{Eren}} had saved {{ her(Polan'il) }}. Joy at seeing {{Eren}} alive soured into guilt. 
Then {{Eren}} frowned down at the ground. {{ She(Eren) }} stared at the patch of fungus between them.
{{Polan'il}} followed {{Eren}}’s gaze and saw the glint of metal nestled in the spongy pink. The compass.
{{Eren}} started to dismount, one long leg swinging down off the saddle. Into the fungus.
{{Polan'il}} called out, “No! {{Eren}}. It’s poisonous!”
But it was too late, {{Eren}} was standing in the middle of the patch of toxic plants, picking up the compass.
“{{Polan'il}}?” {{Eren}} called out. “Is that you?” The knight swayed, {{ herd(Eren) }} skin turning a sickly shade of green, then the knight toppled.
***
{{Polan'il}} caught {{Eren}} before {{ she(Eren) }} fell into the stream.
{{Eren}} blinked, {{ herd(Eren) }} brow furrowing in pain. “I don’t feel so good.”
“Yes, it was the Cymanti fungus. It’s poisonous. But don’t worry. It’s not lethal. You can’t die from it.”
“Of course I won’t die,” {{Eren}} shook {{ herd(Eren) }} head and staggered to {{ herd(Eren) }} feet, “I’m wearing my lucky gloves.”
{{Polan'il}} couldn’t help but smile. {{ She(Polan'il) }} took the knight’s arm and guided {{ her(Eren) }} back to {{ herd(Eren) }} mount. “Let’s go back to the sanctuary. You can lie down and rest. I’ll head out and warn our tribes of the Cymanti threat.”
“I'll go with you.” {{Eren}} clung to {{Polan'il}} , wincing as a wave of pain washed over {{ her(Eren) }}.
“No. You need to lie down and be still. The only cure for the poison is time and rest.”
“I can’t rest now. The army will need every soldier it can get to fight those bug beasts. I’ll be fine.” {{Eren}} took a step forward, leaned against a tree, and vomited onto the ground.
“Listen to me, {{Eren}}. This Cymanti poison is potent. It will leave you weak and vulnerable. You’re in no shape to fight. It’s better for you and your comrades if you take some time to purge the poison from your system.”
{{Eren}} heaved again, then bent over, hands braced on {{ herd(Eren) }} knees, shaking slightly. 
{{Polan'il}} sighed. {{ She(Polan'il) }} hated seeing {{Eren}} so ill. And this was {{ herd(Polan'il) }} fault. {{ She(Polan'il) }} should have told {{Eren}} about the fungus right away. How could {{ she(Polan'il) }} make it up to {{Eren}} and warn {{ herd(Polan'il) }} people about the Cymanti encroachment? {{ She(Polan'il) }} needed more time.
The unicorn whinnied nervously. A cool breeze chilled {{ herd(Polan'il) }} skin. {{Polan'il}} strained {{ herd(Polan'il) }} ears, listening for more insect noises, but {{ she(Polan'il) }} only heard the wind stirring the leaves in the oaks
{{Polan'il}} couldn't leave {{Eren}} like this. Once {{Eren}} was well, {{Polan'il}} would leave {{ her(Eren) }}, but not yet, not here.
{{Eren}} sagged against the tree. “This is like a terrible hangover. But it's worse because I didn’t have the fun of getting drunk.”
{{Polan'il}} thought of the nearby village and its fabled wine. That gave {{ her(Polan'il) }} an idea. “Let’s find that village you were thinking of, the one with the inn. We can stay there for a while. You can rest and recover while I send messengers to the embassy with information about the Cymanti.”
“You’ll stay with me?” {{Eren}} asked, {{ herd(Eren) }} face a mix of hope and green.
{{Polan'il}} put {{ herd(Polan'il) }} arm around {{Eren}}’s shoulders. “Yes, at least until you’re better.”
{{Eren}} gave a faint smile, “Hah. Then you’ll be stuck with me forever. I’ll always be a bad {{ girl(Eren) }}.”

<h2>Chapter 10: Mulberry Wine</h2>
The nearby village was too small for an inn, but the baker let the two of them stay in one of {{ herd(Beatrice) }} rooms. Delicious smells of yeast bread and sugary pies wafted up to the small bedroom. A curtained window looked out onto the village square, letting the morning light spill onto the frayed carpet. At first the baker had been skeptical of an Elyrion and a Polaris sharing a room together, but when the knight explained to the villager about the peace treaty, the {{ woman(Beatrice) }} relented. 
For three days, {{Eren}} lay in bed, sometimes sleeping, sometimes vomiting, sometimes doing {{ herd(Eren) }} best to embarrass {{Polan'il}} with dirty jokes. When {{Polan'il}} wasn’t taking notes on the comings and goings of the townsfolk, {{ she(Polan'il) }} tended to {{Eren}}. {{Polan'il}} cleaned {{ her(Eren) }} up, kept {{ her(Eren) }} comfortable, and spoonfed {{ her(Eren) }} soup when {{ she(Eren) }} could keep the food down. 
Besides caring for {{Eren}}, there wasn’t much else for {{Polan'il}} to do but wait, observe the patterns of the bakery, and think. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had paid one of the village youths to run to the Polaris embassy back in the Elyrion capital and deliver a report on the Cymanti incursion. It still baffled {{Polan'il}} that the bugs had made it so far into Elyrion territory. It also amazed {{ her(Polan'il) }} that the {{ Emperor }} had invested in so many unicorn sanctuaries. Why was the ruler so obsessed with nature preserves? On top of those mysteries, it made {{ her(Polan'il) }} anxious not knowing what to do next. {{ She(Polan'il) }} felt better having a plan and information. But all {{ she(Polan'il) }} could do was wait for {{Eren}} to get better or for new orders from Polaris headquarters. 
On the fourth day, {{Eren}} regained {{ herd(Eren) }} appetite. “Dragon’s dreams, what is that smell?” {{Eren}} sat up in bed, {{ herd(Eren) }} skin no longer tinged with green.
{{Polan'il}} put away the map {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d been using to sketch out the possible ways the Cymanti could have gotten into Elyrion lands. {{ She(Polan'il) }} turned to watch {{Eren}} stand and stretch, the {{ woman(Eren) }}’s muscles rippling along {{ herd(Eren) }} arms and shoulders. By the Ice, {{ she(Eren) }} was marvelous. {{Polan'il}} tore {{ herd(Polan'il) }} eyes away from the {{ woman(Eren) }}’s strong body. “The baker makes a delicious tomato pie, also a wicked fruit tart.”
“You're the only wicked tart I want.” {{Eren}} came up behind {{Polan'il}} and wrapped {{ herd(Eren) }} arms around {{Polan'il}}’s waist. {{ She(Eren) }} kissed the nape of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} neck, making {{Polan'il}} close {{ herd(Polan'il) }} eyes and sigh in pleasure. Then {{Eren}} stepped back, “But that pie sounds good, too. How about I eat that, then I eat you?”
{{Polan'il}} felt a flush of heat in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} face and other parts of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} body. Ice and Ashes how {{ she(Polan'il) }} wanted to climb into bed with {{Eren}}. Instead, {{ she(Polan'il) }} took {{Eren}}’s hand, pulling the big {{ woman(Eren) }} towards the door. “Come on, let’s go get you some food.”
The two of them enjoyed one of the baker’s savory pies and a pot of wildflower tea at a table in the kitchen downstairs. Sun light spilled in from the large window. Flower pots lined the windowsill framing the view in colorful blossoms. 
“Sparks! This tomato pie is amazing,” {{Eren}} beamed, stuffing another bite into {{ herd(Eren) }} mouth, crumbs cascading down {{ herd(Eren) }} face. “It is both juicy, salty, and good looking, all at once. Kind of like me.”
As {{Polan'il}} laughed and chewed, the baker, {{Beatrice}}, smiled at them, {{ herd(Beatrice) }} dimples digging into {{ herd(Beatrice) }} plump cheeks. “Aren’t you two just lovely? I never thought I’d see the day when an Elyrion and a Polaris would sit in my kitchen and enjoy a meal together.” {{ She(Beatrice) }} refilled {{Polan'il}}’s mug and shook {{ herd(Beatrice) }} head. “I know what some folks say about Polaris, that they are too cool and calculating, but that’s not true. Seeing the two of you together shows that friendship can melt even the iciest of hearts.”
{{Eren}} swallowed a mouthful of pie and mumbled, “Oh, {{ she(Polan'il) }}’s not as frigid as {{ she(Polan'il) }} pretends to be. Even the {{ Emperor }} warmed up to {{ her(Polan'il) }}.”
{{Beatrice}} put on an apron and nodded. “Our {{ Emperor }} is a wise and gracious ruler. {{ He(Emperor) }} was smart to get Polaris to agree to the peace treaty.” 
{{Polan'il}} nearly choked, then regained {{ herd(Polan'il) }} composure. {{ She(Polan'il) }} chose a tactful response to the baker’s overly patriotic comment. “Yes, and soon Elyrion will have their own embassy in Polaris. It will be even better for our two peoples.” {{ She(Polan'il) }} took a sip of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} tea and savored the fragrant heat sliding down {{ herd(Polan'il) }} throat.
The baker turned to the sink and the pile of dishes.
{{Eren}} leaned close and whispered, “Can you get our host out of the house for a while? Say an hour or so?”
{{Polan'il}} felt {{ herd(Polan'il) }} heart beat faster. {{ She(Polan'il) }} knew what {{Eren}} was asking and {{ she(Polan'il) }} was sorely tempted. Why hold back? The two of them were together and safe for the moment. They both knew the peace couldn’t last, or their relationship. They’d both acknowledged the short term nature of the alliance. {{ She(Polan'il) }} might as well enjoy being with {{Eren}}, at least for a little while. Soon enough, the Peace would break, but for now, {{Polan'il}} could savor the moment. 
{{Polan'il}} looked out the window. {{ She(Polan'il) }} saw a tall figure with a bright green hat walk past with a basket. Perfect timing.
“Isn’t that {{Trevor}}, the tailor? Looks like {{ he(Trevor) }} is going to {{Rosalie}}’s house.”
{{Beatrice}} stopped washing dishes and looked up, a deep crease across {{ her(Beatrice) }} brow.. “{{Trevor}}? Going to {{Rosalie}}’s?” 
The baker dried {{ herd(Beatrice) }} hands, hung {{ herd(Beatrice) }} apron on a hook, and grabbed a pastry box and a flask from the counter. “I’m going out for a bit. You two enjoy the rest of the pie.”
After {{Beatrice}} closed the door behind {{ her(Beatrice) }}, {{Eren}} asked, “Wow. Good job getting rid of our host. How’d you do it?”
A proud smile crept onto {{Polan'il}}’s face, “I like to watch people. I observe their patterns. Our host admires the tailor. Every time {{Trevor}} comes into the shop, {{ she(Beatrice) }} fawns and flirts. {{Rosalie}} also is fond of {{Trevor}}. {{ She(Rosalie) }} lingers with {{ him(Trevor) }} in the street, touching {{ hisd(Trevor) }} arm, laughing too hard at {{ hisd(Trevor) }} jokes. {{Trevor}} can’t decide between the two.”
“So {{Rosalie}} and {{Beatrice}} are rivals?”
“Exactly, and if {{ herd(Beatrice) }} previous patterns hold, {{Beatrice}} will invite {{Trevor}} for a nice picnic somewhere.”
{{Eren}} beamed at {{Polan'il}}. “Colors. Have I told you how devious you are?”
{{Polan'il}} laughed. “I aim to please.”
{{Eren}} grinned at {{Polan'il}}, “I’ve had enough pie. I want some of you now.”
{{Polan'il}} took {{Eren}}’s hand, “I want you too.”
They went back upstairs.

<h2>Chapter 11: Redirection</h2>

The next day, {{Polan'il}} woke to {{Eren}}’s hand on {{ herd(Polan'il) }} hip, gently nudging {{ her(Polan'il) }}. “Time to wake up, sleepyhead. We have an embassy to build. Remember?”
{{Polan'il}} stretched and rubbed the sleep from {{ herd(Polan'il) }} eyes. Sun streamed in through the window, leaving a square of light on the quilt. Smells of fresh baked bread warmed the room. 
The two of them had stayed up late. Re-learning each other's bodies. {{Polan'il}} had found a particularly sensitive spot behind {{Eren}}’s delicate ears that made the knight roar like a leoon. 
{{Polan'il}} looked {{Eren}} over. {{ She(Eren) }} was sitting on the edge of the bed in {{ herd(Eren) }} knightley regalia, the lucky pink gloves back in place. “Are you sure you are feeling up to it? The poison may still be in your system. Maybe we should rest here one more day and make sure you are back to full strength.”
“I’m feeling well. I already ran through all my training regimen this morning -- pushups, lunges, sit ups, unicorn lifts.” {{ She(Eren) }} grinned and added, “If you think what we did in bed was me not at my full strength, I worry what you expect from me next time.”
At the phrase ‘next time,’ heat flooded {{Polan'il}}’s face. “Hey, you’re the one who was telling me I needed to learn to relax and enjoy life.” {{Polan'il}} made a face of mock skepticism, squinting at {{Eren}}. “Since when are you so responsible?”
{{Eren}} laughed, “Since I became a knight of the Empire. It is my job, you know.”
“I must admit your battle skills are impressive. The way you tore through those bugs outside the unicorn sanctuary was like nothing I’ve seen before.” {{Polan'il}} ran {{ herd(Polan'il) }} hand along {{Eren}}’s arm, then back down to {{ herd(Eren) }} hand, playing with {{ herd(Eren) }} fingers. “Maybe you could tear through me like that sometime.”
{{Eren}} let out a throaty sigh. “When you say things like that, you make it impossible for me to remember the thing … whatever it was I was trying to get us to do… you know … the thing.” {{ She(Eren) }} kissed {{Polan'il}}’s hand. “You are a sneaky {{ woman(Polan'il) }}. You know that?”
“Thank you. I strive for excellence.” {{Polan'il}} reached up and kissed {{Eren}} softly. 
{{Eren}} responded with a soft moan and sank down onto the bed. “Alright, but after this we go do our jobs. Agreed?”
***
An hour later the two of them were on the road to Polaris. The sun was high in the sky. Cheery clouds spread across the sky and a gentle breeze played in the trees. Farms stretched out in the valley to the east, green stems ripening to golden grain. This time, {{Polan'il}} rode behind {{Eren}}, the two pressed comfortably together.
A group of Polaris merchants passed them on the road, their furred hoods ruffling in the wind. {{Polan'il}} didn’t recognize any of the Polaris, but then again, {{ she(Polan'il) }} worked in the diplomatic department, not the ice trade. The traders bowed to both {{Eren}} and {{Polan'il}} as  they passed. {{Polan'il}} nodded. {{Eren}} blew a kiss in acknowledgment. 
What a difference peace made. 
The last time {{Polan'il}} had passed this way, {{ she(Polan'il) }} had stayed off the roads and stayed out of sight. {{ She(Polan'il) }}’d slept on the ground and eaten cold rations. It had taken twice as long to move across the countryside. Now, with the peace in place, {{ she(Polan'il) }} and other Polaris could move freely about the Elyrion terrain, enjoy the local hospitality, and even walk arm and arm with an Elyrion knight in the open. It felt good.
{{Eren}} kept {{ herd(Eren) }} eyes on the road and asked, “That thing you did with the baker, getting information on them and then using it to get what you want, do they teach you that at the Embassy? Is that spy stuff?”
{{Polan'il}} chose {{ herd(Polan'il) }} words carefully, “I’ve always observed people. Watched from the shadows. Used it to my advantage. Growing up, my parents were … volatile. If I wasn’t careful, I would get hurt. So I learned to stay out of their way, watch, and learn. I had to, to survive.”
{{Eren}} twisted around to face {{Polan'il}} and put an arm around {{ her(Polan'il) }}. “That sounds awful, but it made you who you are and I like you for it.”  It was an awkward embrace, the two of them in the saddle, but still felt good.
After a moment, {{Eren}} dropped {{ herd(Eren) }} arm and faced forward again, the unicorn plodding forward, undeterred by the riders’ exchange.
{{Polan'il}} scanned their surroundings. The road stretched north, towards the Polaris border behind the dark forest. {{ She(Polan'il) }} saw a group of pink-clad workers in the oak forest. The Elyrion workers waved as {{ she(Polan'il) }} and {{Eren}} passed by. 
“What are those Elyrion doing?” {{Polan'il}} asked. 
“That's the conservation corps. It is the {{ Emperor }}’s personal project. {{ He(Emperor) }}’s a major nature lover.”
“Oh, like the unicorn sanctuaries.” 
“More than the unicorns. {{ He(Emperor) }} has been funding breeding programs for all kinds of rare species, in the forest, the sea, and the air. The {{ Emperor }} has a soft heart for wild animals. Always has.”
“It would be better for the war effort if the {{ Emperor }} had directed more resources to the army instead of nature conservation.”
{{Eren}} bristled and straightened in the saddle. “Hey, Elyrion has some knights now. That counts towards an army. I’m not just some pretty face in fancy armor.”
{{Polan'il}} chuckled, “Yes, yes. You are as skilled as you are vain.” {{ She(Polan'il) }} paused thinking about what {{Eren}} had said about the knights and their training. Time to find out more. “You must have a well organized system for getting knights -- squires, a training regimen, even lucky gloves. How do…” {{ She(Polan'il) }} trailed off as something caught {{ herd(Polan'il) }} eye. 
A lone figure in pink was approaching from the south.
{{Eren}} turned to see what had caught {{Polan'il}}’s attention. “Oh. Looks like a squire.”
The pink figure was getting closer, moving very fast.
{{Polan'il}} said, “Coming from the direction of the capital.”
{{Eren}} reigned the unicorn to a stop, waiting for the squire.
A few minutes later, the squire skidded to a halt next to them, unicorn damp with sweat and breathing hard.
“{{ Damee(Eren) }} {{Eren}},” the squire, a young {{ lad(squire) }} with big eyes, was also out of breath, “I have an urgent message from the {{ Emperor }}. We are under attack. All forces needed in ∑∑₼πo city.” {{ She(squire) }} handed the knight a scroll. 
{{Eren}} unrolled the piece parchment. {{Polan'il}} twisted so {{ she(squire) }} could read over {{ herd(Eren) }} shoulder.

 {{ Dame(Eren) }} {{Eren}},
∑∑₼πo city is being attacked by Cymanti. We have weak defenses and will be overrun unless reinforcements arrive quickly. Do whatever it takes to keep the city from falling to the bugs. The Polaris spy must return to home. 

{{Eren}} tucked the parchment away, frowning. “Thank you, squire. I will head to the battle immediately. Spread the word to the conservation corp and any other Elyrion forces you find.” 
“Yes, {{ Ma-am(Eren) }}.” The squire saluted and spurred {{ herd(squire) }} unicorn away.
{{Polan'il}}’s mind spun with questions. How did the {{ Emperor }} know ∑∑₼πo city was under attack? ∑∑₼πo was to the west but the {{ Emperor }} was in the capitol to the south. Also, how had {{ he(Emperor) }} known to send a squire here? Perhaps {{Conner}} had written this command, not the {{ Emperor }}. Had the Elyrion forces intercepted {{Polan'il}}’s communications to the Polaris embassy? Above all, why did they not want {{Polan'il}} in Elyrion? 
{{Polan'il}} had to uncover the truth.
Before {{Eren}} could say more, {{Polan'il}} said, “I’m coming with you.”
“But the {{ Emperor }}’s orders…”
“Said to do whatever it takes. I have some contacts in ∑∑₼πo city. I can help.”
{{Eren}} looked down and sucked in a long breath, {{ herd(Eren) }} hand gripping the reins tight. “I don’t like to disobey a direct written order.”
“{{Eren}}, I'm going to ∑∑₼πo, either with you or on my own.” {{Polan'il}} reached for {{Eren}}’s hand and squeezed. “I’d rather be by your side.”
The knight let out a sigh, “Me too. I don't want you to go back to Polaris. Just don’t tell the {{ Emperor }}, okay?”

<h2>Chapter 12: Sieged</h2>
{{Polan'il}} could smell the smoke on the east wind before {{ she(Polan'il) }} could see the flames.
As they rounded the hill, {{Eren}} swore, “Sparks! We’re too late.”
Smoke and fire shot up from ∑∑₼πo, a smudge of pink and white stone nestled in a verdant valley. Hexapods swarmed the outlying farms. Bodies of Elyrion warriors were strewn across the land, their pink uniforms muddy and dark. A massive centipede, the length of several houses, slithered through the city, knocking down buildings. They were to far away to hear the screams of terror the beast must be causing.
“No, there is still time.” {{Polan'il}} said, “Give me a moment to think.”
{{Polan'il}} counted the enemy forces, noticing a pattern. The bugs were in formation. {{ She(Polan'il) }} assessed the layout of the city, the mountains to the west, the lake to the north. 
 {{ Her(Polan'il) }} mind spun, cycling through each of the possible approaches. 
If {{Eren}} came at them from the right angle, through the closest farm, the knight could destroy  them all. Well, nearly all. The centipede was too much, even for a mighty knight. But if {{Polan'il}}  could activate {{ herd(Polan'il) }} secret agents within the city, together, they could defeat the bugs. 
“You see a way to take back the city?” {{Eren}}’s eyes sparkled with hope and something more, eagerness.
“Yes, but only if you follow my plan and strike in a certain order. You have to wipe out the hexapods first, then attack the centipede from behind.” 
The centipede knocked down another building inside the city. Smoke and debris exploded into the sky. The bug’s body twisted and bulged, growing a new segment, making the creature even larger.
“From behind?” {{Eren}} asked. “I know you enjoy watching me be kinky, but it would be easier for me to attack from the front. A lance through the eye should do it.”
{{Polan'il}} held back a smile. “No, the creature can regenerate. See how it grows unnaturally. If you take down the head, a new one will rise in its place.”
{{Eren}} shook {{ herd(Eren) }} head, and made a ‘tsk’ sound, “I knew a guy like that once. Amazing stamina.”
{{Polan'il}} started to ask, “You knew a guy like…” then {{ she(Polan'il) }} trailed off.  A new idea hit {{ her(Polan'il) }}. Was it possible? 
{{ She(Polan'il) }} did the mental math. Ran the plan in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} mind again. Yes. If {{Eren}}’s agents coordinated with {{Polan'il}}’s attack in precisely the right way, in the right time, the Polaris forces could claim the city for themselves. It would work!
This could be the perfect time to start the Polaris offensive against Elyrion. Once Polaris seized this city, they could easily use it as a springboard to launch Polaris troops at the Elyrion capitol. Elyrion would be caught off guard, soft and easy to destroy. With Elyrion defeated, Polaris could turn their attention to Cymanti and destroy all their foes. {{Polan'il}} saw the plan unfolding in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} mind. Polaris victorious across the entire Square. And {{Eren}}, lost to {{Polan'il}} forever.
Shame twisted {{Polan'il}}’s gut. {{Polan'il}} had to make a choice - {{ herd(Polan'il) }} duty or {{ herd(Polan'il) }} heart. 
{{ She(Polan'il) }} made up {{ herd(Polan'il) }} mind. 
{{Polan'il}} took a deep breath. {{ She(Polan'il) }} dismounted, letting the warmth of {{Polan'il}}’s body fall away. {{ She(Polan'il) }} forced {{ herd(Polan'il) }} tone to be calm and confident as {{ she(Polan'il) }} gave {{Eren}} instructions. “Wait here. When I give the signal, charge through the hexapod formation, then attack the centipede from the rear. Do not attack until I have my agents in place. Do you understand?”
“You’re going into ∑∑₼πo alone? You’ll get crushed.”
{{Polan'il}} took off {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak, flipped it inside out, and wrapped {{ herself(Polan'il) }} in the furred side, letting the slippery material turn {{ her(Polan'il) }} invisible. {{ She(Polan'il) }} pulled back the hood, letting {{Eren}} see {{ herd(Polan'il) }} face. “The bugs won’t see me.”
{{Eren}}’s eyes widened, “Sparks! How’d you do that?”
“Spy tricks.”
Then {{Eren}} frowned, looking back to the smoky city. “And how do you know your people down there are alive?”
{{Polan'il}} took a deep breath, “You’ll have to trust me on this. I have a plan.” {{ She(Polan'il) }} pulled the hood up over {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head, disappearing from sight. 
“Wait!” {{Eren}} called out. {{ She(Eren) }} tugged at one of {{ herd(Eren) }} gloves, the pink leather clinging to {{ herd(Eren) }} hand. Finally, the glove came free and {{Eren}} held it out.“Take this. It will keep you safe.”
{{Polan'il}} swallowed hard. Guilt tore at {{ her(Polan'il) }} as {{ she(Polan'il) }} reached out, taking the token of affection, “Thank you. This means so much to me. You mean so much to me. {{Eren}}, if I don’t…”
“Nope. No goodbyes. We both have a lucky glove. They will keep us safe. Now go do your sneaky thing that you do. Wave the glove high in the air when you want me to charge.”
{{Polan'il}} tucked {{Eren}}’s glove away under {{ herd(Eren) }} cloak and ran down the hill, towards the burning city.

<h2>Chapter 13: Hideout</h2>
It took {{Polan'il}} more time than {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d expected to find the Polaris safehouse in ∑∑₼πo city. Smoke and dust choked the air. Piles of pink and white rumble clogged the streets. Dead Elyrion  citizens and soldiers lay where they had fallen, their bodies mangled or trampled.
The giant centipede was tearing the city apart.
{{Polan'il}} was hyper-vigilant, checking and rechecking doors, windows, alleys, for any sign of giant bugs or other danger. {{ She(Polan'il) }}’d had to go the long way around to avoid the monstrous bug. {{ She(Polan'il) }} prayed the Polaris agents were still at  their secret base and had followed orders.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} passed an empty cafe, its tables and chairs overturned, half-eaten food and broken dishes scattered in the street. 
A Cymanti warrior in dark green armor lay slumped against the railing. {{Polan'il}} slowed. {{ She(Polan'il) }}’d never been this close to a Cymanti before, alive or dead. From the neck down, the soldier looked like a normal person, arms, legs, body all normal. But the head. The head was different. 
A massive grub was affixed to the warrior’s head, like an oversized helmet. It was said that the bugs bonded with the people, giving them strange abilities. Even in death, the compound eyes of the huge bug glittered from the forehead of the warrior.
How could someone willingly agree to have a bug connected to their brain?
Finally, {{Polan'il}} found the low building with the snowflake carved into the lintel over the door. {{ She(Polan'il) }} looked up and down the smokey street. It was lifeless, just like all the other streets. {{ She(Polan'il) }} pounded on the door six times. Six for the sacred number of points in a snowflake. No one answered.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} scanned the area again, checking again for soldiers or bystanders. Elyrion citizens were either hiding inside their homes, had fled the city, or dead. 
Although {{ she(Polan'il) }} couldn’t see {{ her(Eren) }}, {{ she(Polan'il) }} imagined {{Eren}} up on the hill, perched on {{ herd(Eren) }} unicorn, lance poised, waiting for {{Polan'il}}’s signal. {{ She(Polan'il) }} fingered the glove in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} pocket. Doubt crept in. Should {{ she(Polan'il) }} have refused the token of affection? Was this a huge mistake? Was there anyone left alive in this place to put {{ herd(Polan'il) }} plan in motion? {{ She(Polan'il) }} shook {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head, pushing down the doubts. It was too late to turn back now.
 {{ She(Polan'il) }} pounded on the door again and called out in Polarisi, “Anyone there?”
No response.
If the Polaris agents were alive inside, they were either too scared to open the door or unsure if they could trust {{ herd(Polan'il) }}. If they were not alive … {{Polan'il}} weighed {{ herd(Polan'il) }} options. {{ She(Polan'il) }} took a risk and flipped {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak right side out, the white fur trim standing out like a white rabbit in a field of dark stone. 
{{ She(Polan'il) }} banged on the door again. Disregarding protocol, {{ she(Polan'il) }} called out in Polarisi, “By the Blessed Gaami, let me in. I’m {{Polan'il}}, Agent of Polaris. I work with Ambassador {{Anpolta}}. I’m here to help.”
A crash exploded from down the street. Wet chittering noises followed the crash. A plume of smoke shot into the sky.
A soft voice, almost a squeak, replied in Polarisi from behind the door. “How do we know you’re Polaris?” 
“Oh for Snow’s sake, let me in. If I was a bug, I wouldn’t be knocking on the door.”
The door opened revealing a pale {{woman (Dagger1) }}’s face framed by a furred hood. {{Polan'il}} dashed inside the small, lantern lit room. Maps of ∑∑₼πo were nailed to the walls. Three Polaris agents huddled around a wooden table loaded with anti-Elyrion propaganda.
“Comrades, it is time.” {{Polan'il}} put both hands on the table and leaned forward. “You’ve trained and prepared. This is the moment to act.”
Another crash sounded from outside followed by screams.
“Now? With that monster growing larger with every hour and bugs swarming the city? Are you crazy?” the hooded Polaris asked, {{ herd(Dagger1) }} voice trembling. “There is no way we can defeat them, even if we stir up a riot.”
“I have a plan. I’m coordinating with an Elyrion ally, a knight. Together, we can make it work, but you have to follow my instructions.”
“What about the peace treaty? We got a message from the ambassador about that.”
“Yes, but the treaty is temporary. That was a ruse from the beginning. Now is the best time to strike.” {{Polan'il}} pulled one of the maps from the wall and laid it on the table.  “We can easily claim the city. Like this.” 
{{Polan'il}} snatched a stick of charcoal and started drawing out a plan of attack on the map. The three Polaris agents leaned in, watching {{ her(Polan'il) }} draw out arrows, circles, and lines. 
“Our goal is to rid ∑∑₼πo of the bugs and take the city for ourselves” 
{{Polan'il}} glanced at a stack of leaflets with slogans like, “Down with the {{ Emperor }}” and “Elyrion resources for the Elyrion people, not the {{ Emperor }}.”
“Leave the propaganda here. There is no time to spread leaflets. Call for the citizens to stand up to their attackers. If we follow this plan, the Elyrion left in the city will be grateful for our help and you’ll all get commendations. But the timing has to be perfect.”
{{ She(Polan'il) }} looked up, scanning {{ herd(Polan'il) }} comrads’ faces, waiting for them to ask more questions or object. 
Did they see the flaw in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} plan? Could they hear the lies?
There was another crash from outside. The building shook. Dust and splinters drifted down from above. The lanterns on the ceiling swayed, the lines of light across the map rolling back and forth.
{{Polan'il}} coughed, then commanded. “Time to go. Now.” {{ She(Polan'il) }} opened the door, “For Polaris!”
The others echoed, “For Polaris,” and rushed outside.
“Time to start a riot,” {{Polan'il}} said.
Time for betrayal.

<h2>Chapter 14: Best Laid Plans</h2>
{{Polan'il}} coughed through the haze. The smoke was getting thicker as more buildings caught fire on the other side of the city. {{ She(Polan'il) }} nearly tripped over a small body, blue hair dark with blood. {{ She(Polan'il) }} forced {{ herself(Polan'il) }} to look away. The streets were eerily quiet, as if the city was holding its breath, anticipating the dagger to plunge in deep.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} ran across the cobblestones, {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak tight about {{ her(Polan'il) }}, keeping {{ her(Polan'il) }} invisible. {{ She(Polan'il) }} needed to get to a high point where {{ she(Polan'il) }} could see the riot, {{ herd(Polan'il) }} agents, the centipede, and signal {{Eren}}. Most of the buildings were single story, pink and white stone, with blue tiled roofs. {{ She(Polan'il) }} needed a higher vantage point. 
Remembering the map {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d marked up, {{Polan'il}} made for the center of the city. A temple should be there, an ornate structure with a tall tower, if it hadn’t been destroyed already.
It took longer than {{Polan'il}} expected to find the temple and even longer to find a way inside. A group of refugees were huddled inside the main sanctuary. {{ She(Polan'il) }} skirted the edge of the chamber and found a stairway that led up to the bell tower. 
From the top of the tower {{ she(Polan'il) }} should see the entire city. Blue roofs under a blanket of smoke, rubble, and terror. The giant centipede slithered through the western corner of the city, sending fresh spouts of smoke and screams into the air. 
The creature was getting bigger.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} looked to the other corners of ∑∑₼πo. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} three agents at  their positions, clusters of outraged Elyrion folk around  them, shouting and raising their fists in anger. 
Yes. Good. The riot was starting as planned. 
Next came the betrayal.
Once {{ herd(Polan'il) }} people attacked the centipede’s head, {{ she(Polan'il) }} would signal {{Eren}}. With the monster weakened, {{Eren}} would easily be able to destroy the enormous bug if the knight attacked from behind, catching it off guard. That way, {{Eren}} would kill the beast and be the hero. ∑∑₼πo would stay under Elyrion control and the peace would hold. 
{{Polan'il}} was willing to sacrifice {{ herd(Polan'il) }} own people to keep the peace, and to keep {{Eren}}, at least for a little while longer.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} turned to the hillside, where {{Eren}} was waiting on {{ herd(Eren) }} unicorn. 
Good. 
Hope surged through {{Polan'il}}. This might actually work. {{ She(Polan'il) }} took off {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak, revealing {{ herself(Polan'il) }}. {{Eren}} would have to see {{Polan'il}} clearly to notice {{ herd(Polan'il) }} signal to strike.
Then {{Polan'il}} saw smudges on the west hill. 
Pink figures. Blasting Blizzards!
{{Polan'il}} squinted, unable to make out the details. It had to be Elylrion troops, but how? Where had they come from? Were they going to join the fight? Would {{Eren}} leave?
{{Polan'il}} hated uncertainty. 
Shouts of protest pulled {{ herd(Polan'il) }} attention back to the city. “Bash the bugs!” and “Save the ∑∑₼πo,” echoed from the streets below. The rioters and the monster were getting closer. 
The centipede was almost at the temple.
{{Polan'il}} saw two of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} agents left in the crowd. The creature lunged for the rioters, swallowing some whole, crushing others.
{{Polan'il}} glanced back to the hill. Several Elyrion riders crested the hill, making for the formation of hexapods on the outskirts of the city. {{Eren}} was not there. 
Where had the knight gone? Ice and Ashes! This was not good.
A flash of white and pink moving fast caught {{Polan'il}}’s eye. {{Eren}} was charging into ∑∑₼πo, {{ herd(Eren) }} lance drawn, aiming for the mob and the beast’s head.
{{Polan'il}} called out, “{{Eren}}, wait. Don’t attack there!” {{ She(Polan'il) }} waved frantically, but it was no use.
{{Eren}} didn’t waiver, {{ herd(Eren) }} mount galloping directly for the centipede’s head.
Rioters moved in to take the place of the fallen, jabbing at the enormous insect, leaving cracks in its carapace. It was weak now. There was still a chance, if {{Eren}} changed {{ herd(Eren) }} course…
{{Eren}} ran {{ herd(Eren) }} lance through the centipede’s eye. The creature’s head cracked open, like shelling a giant nut. Its body shuddered and stilled.
No. No. No. 
Dread coursed through {{Polan'il}}. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} plan was falling apart. Could {{ she(Polan'il) }} still salvage the peace?
The crowd roared in triumph. People embraced each other and started to sing an Elyrion anthem.
{{Eren}} waved to the crowd, puffing up with pride. 
The knight turned and waved to {{Polan'il}}. “I did it!” {{ she(Eren) }}cried out. 
Except that {{ she(Eren) }} hadn’t. Why had {{Eren}} not followed the plan? This was a disaster.
There was no time for questions. {{Polan'il}} had to figure out a new plan. Calculations flew through {{ herd(Polan'il) }} mind, considering {{ herd(Polan'il) }} options.
The body of the giant centipede twitched once. 
{{Polan'il}} shouted, “Watch out. It is going to regenerate!” 
The monster convulsed again. This time, the crowd noticed and gasped in fear. 
{{Eren}} turned to look at the twitching monster, {{ herd(Eren) }} unicorn rearing and backing away.
As the centipede writhed, the puss from its smashed skull bubbled and congealed. The crowd backed away. {{Polan'il}} could see one of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} agents near the beast, blade drawn.
There was still a chance {{ herd(Polan'il) }} plan might work. 
{{Polan'il}} shouted to {{ herd(Polan'il) }} Polaris agents, “Remember. It will grow a new head. Weaken it, but don’t kill it. Let the knight attack from the base of the skull, from behind.” {{ She(Polan'il) }} added, “{{Eren}}, you have to attack from the…”
The beast lunged. It’s massive mouth swallowing anything and everything, including the Polaris spy. 
“Watch out!” {{Polan'il}} screamed, but it was too late.

<h2>Chapter 15: Knight Chain</h2>
Cries of terror echoed from the smoky streets as the mob scattered. 
{{Eren}} struggled to maneuver {{ herd(Eren) }} mount. {{ Herd(Eren) }} unicorn wheeled around, then galloped away from the beast.
The monster’s new head, slick with blood and puss, swayed, searching for more prey.
Sounds of metal on flesh at the city gates made {{Polan'il}} look away. A squad of Elyrion riders galloped in.
{{Polan'il}} counted the Elyrion reinforcements. So many. How? From where? It didn’t add up. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} spy network hadn’t said anything about a force of Elyrion riders. {{ She(Polan'il) }} looked for {{ herd(Polan'il) }} own people. There was only one Polaris agent left, huddled in a doorway.
{{Eren}}’s battle cry tore {{Polan'il}}’s attention back to the western corner of the city. The knight was charging at the monster, lance held firmly, aiming for the back of the beast. 
No. This was all wrong. {{Eren}} wouldn’t be able to destroy the creature all by {{ herself(Eren) }}, even if {{ she(Eren) }} did attack from the rear.
{{Polan'il}} wanted to crumble to the ground but {{ she(Polan'il) }} couldn’t look away. {{ She(Polan'il) }} bit {{ herd(Polan'il) }} lip and forced away the fear. {{Polan'il}} forced {{ herself(Polan'il) }} to think. Think.
Yes. There was a way.
Desperately, {{Polan'il}} shouted to the Elyrion riders at the western gates, “Help. Attack the centipede. Now!” 
{{ She(Polan'il) }} pointed towards {{Eren}} and the monster, hoping the riders would understand {{ herd(Polan'il) }} gestures, even if they could not hear {{ her(Polan'il) }}.
{{Eren}}’s battle cry drew {{Polan'il}}’s attention. The knight had torn through the centipede’s body, trampling the entire creature to a pulp. Its new head was cracked, but still moving, still alive.  The creature opened its mouth, jaws coming down hard on the unicorn. 
{{Eren}} was knocked from {{ herd(Eren) }} saddle. {{ She(Eren) }} slammed into the ground hard.
{{Polan'il}} gasped, “No! {{Eren}}!” But {{ she(Polan'il) }} was too far away to help.
And then the troop of riders descended on the monster, unicorn tails flashing rainbows as the centipede was at last destroyed. 
{{Polan'il}} ran down from the tower, all attempts at stealth abandoned. {{ She(Polan'il) }} raced to {{Eren}}’s side, the {{ woman(Eren) }}’s massive body lying limp on the cobblestones.
“{{Eren}}. {{Eren}}? Please be alright.” {{Polan'il}} pleaded, reaching for {{ herd(Polan'il) }} lover.
{{Eren}} stirred and looked up at {{Polan'il}}. {{ She(Eren) }} blinked and smiled. “You know I could never be all right. I’d rather be at least some wrong. Being right is boring.”
{{Polan'il}} let out a sigh of relief, tears streaming down {{ herd(Polan'il) }} face. {{ She(Polan'il) }} helped {{Eren}} to {{ herd(Eren) }} feet, keeping {{ herd(Polan'il) }} arm around {{Eren}}’s waist.
{{Eren}} winced, but was able to stand on {{ her(Eren) }} own. {{Polan'il}} did not let go. The contact anchored both of them.
{{Polan'il}}’s relief changed to anger, “Why didn’t you follow my instructions, you idiot? I told you not to attack until I gave the signal.”
A low voice answered from behind, stern and commanding, “Because you, Polaris spy, are not in charge of the Elyrion army.”
{{Polan'il}} spun around. {{ Sirr(Conner) }} {{Conner}} sat astride a large unicorn, lance at {{ hisd(Conner) }} side, a confident smirk across {{ hisd(Conner) }} face. 
{{Conner}} turned and waved to the city gates. {{ He(Conner) }} called out, “It is safe now, your Majesty. You may enter.”
Then the {{ Emperor }}, mounted on a gleaming white unicorn, its mane bedecked in ribbons, rode forward, {{ hisd(Emperor) }} eyes narrowed, taking in the carnage.
<h2>Chapter 16: Broken</h2>
{{Polan'il}}’s mind whirled with questions. 
{{Conner}} and the Elyrion {{ Emperor }} here. How? Why? Now what?
The last remaining Polaris agent stepped out of the shadows. The {{ Emperor }} sneered and pointed at the foreigner. “You did this. You and the Polaris.”
{{Polan'il}} sputtered. “Are you blind? The Cymanti attacked ∑∑₼πo. We were trying to help.”
{{Conner}} said, “Yes, the bugs may have caused the initial death and destruction, but the Polaris led them here. It was {their plan all along. They used the excuse of the Cymanti attack to betray us and try to take over.”
Faces framed in blue hair and curiosity peaked out of the windows.
The Polaris agent shrunk back, clutching {{ herd(Polan'il) }} body, the {{ Emperor }}’s words like a dagger in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} gut.
{{Conner}} unrolled a scroll. {{ He(Conner) }} looked to the {{ Emperor }} and asked, “May I?”
The {{ Emperor }} nodded, “Yes, yes. As we discussed.”
{{Conner}} held the piece of paper and continued, “Polaris has conspired to bring Elyrion down. Their actions here prove they never wanted peace, only to ruin our people and conquer our lands.” 
The wind fluttered the paper in the knight’s grip, making it hard to understand, but {{Polan'il}} could make out {{Conner}}’s words, ‘End the Empire.’ It was one of their riot propaganda pamphlets. How had {{ he(Conner) }} found it?
{{Eren}} recoiled from {{Polan'il}}. The sudden loss of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} lover’s warm body next to {{ hers(Polan'il) }} felt like Polan'il’s very life draining away.
{{Eren}}’s eyes were full of pain and confusion, “Sparks! You lied to me. You’ve lied all along.”
{{Polan'il}}’s brain fumbled to make sense of the situation. How could {{ she(Polan'il) }} explain? {{ She(Polan'il) }} had to make things right. “No. I want peace. It’s good for us, for our tribes. I’ve always wanted peace.”
But that last part wasn’t true and {{Polan'il}} could see {{Eren}} didn’t believe {{ her(Polan'il) }}.
{{Eren}} was angry now. {{ Herd(Eren) }} voice shook. “You’re lying. So many lies. And even when you’re not lying, you’re hiding and avoiding.”
“Please. By the Eternal Ice, listen to me. This isn’t what I wanted to happen. If you had followed my plan…”
{{Eren}} cut Polan'il off, “You avoided me in the Capital and you lied about heading for the cliff back in the sanctuary. Tell me, when you came to the Capital, did you actually want a peace treaty or were you there to start a war?”
{{Polan'il}} looked into {{Eren}}’s fierce eyes, full of passion, but not the good kind. For once, {{Polan'il}} couldn’t bring {{ herself(Polan'il) }} to lie.
“You’re right. My mission has always been to set the stage for war, but in the village, I saw how good peace was. Peace was good for our people. Peace was good for us. My plan today was to preserve the peace, to preserve us.”
{{Eren}}’s face was cold, now devoid of emotion. It was like a wave of impassivity had washed over {{Eren}}’s features, wiping away any trace of feelings, love or hate. The emptiness in {{Eren}}’s expression was so unlike {{ her(Eren) }}. It scared {{Polan'il}}.
The {{ Emperor }} called out, “The Peace treaty between Elyrion and Polaris is finished.” {{ He(Emperor ) }} crushed the propaganda pamphlet between {{ hisd(Emperor ) }} two slender hands, then threw the crumpled ball of paper to the ground. 
{{Conner}} nodded and continued to read from {{ hisd(Conner) }} scroll. “Because Polaris broke the peace by attacking this city, all their} assets inside the Empire will be confiscated. Any Polaris traitor found within our borders will be killed on sight.”
In a flash of color, a unicorn rider moved across the square, heading for the Polaris agent who was moving down an ally. The rider struck, swift and smooth. {{Polan'il}}’s last agent collapsed to the cobblestones.
No. Glorious Gaami, no. This could not be happening. {{Polan'il}}’s mind froze. {{ She(Polan'il) }} needed to think, to make a plan, but nothing was making sense. 
{{Eren}} hissed and shrank away, “You broke the peace and my trust. Get out. Out of Elyrion, out of my life.”
{{Polan'il}} didn’t think. {{ She(Polan'il) }} ran.

<h2>Chapter 17: Exile</h2>
Dusk cast murky shadows through the forest, the massive oaks silently judging {{Polan'il}} as {{ she(Polan'il) }} stumbled north, towards Polaris. The spy wrapped {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak tight about {{ herd(Polan'il) }} body, the polished fabric deflecting light, but not {{ herd(Polan'il) }} doubts. {{ She(Polan'il) }} ignored the bird noises and the rustle of leaves. Usually {{ she(Polan'il) }} had elaborate plans, back up plans, and contingency plans. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} mind was too muddled for any of that. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} goal was simple: get home. 
The border was only a day away by foot. {{ She(Polan'il) }} couldn’t use Elyrion roads anymore, but if {{ she(Polan'il) }} crossed through the unicorn sanctuary, {{ she(Polan'il) }} could save some time. Once {{ she(Polan'il) }} crossed the border, {{ she(Polan'il) }} could send word to {{ herd(Polan'il) }} superiors in the capital and wait for further orders. The Polaris spy network was strong. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} commanders would know what to do. 
Night crept over the forest. {{Polan'il}} continued north, towards the Elyrion sanctuary near the border. The mammoth moon, full of icy light, rose over the hills in the west. The mouse moon, yellow and weak, was high overhead, but too faint to provide illumination. The rush of energy from the battle was draining away and fatigue began to drag {{ her(Polan'il) }} down. {{ She(Polan'il) }}’d been moving non-stop for hours. 
A glimmer of light caught {{ herd(Polan'il) }} attention through the trees. {{ She(Polan'il) }} froze, a surge of panic coursing through {{ her(Polan'il) }}. {{ She(Polan'il) }} waited, trusting {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak to protect {{ her(Polan'il) }} from being found.
The pale light ahead didn’t move or make a sound. What was it?
{{ She(Polan'il) }} inched forward. Perhaps {{ she(Polan'il) }} could learn something important about the Elyrion forces and share the information with the Polaris army. {{ She(Polan'il) }} might still be of use to {{ herd(Polan'il) }} people.
From between the trees, {{ she(Polan'il) }} saw it. A massive pillar of crystal with arches reaching out from the top. Like a tree made of iridescent glass. 
{{Polan'il}} sagged against a tree and let out a long breath. It was the sanctuary center. {{ She(Polan'il) }}’d read about this. The crystal column was Elyrion magic that attracted wild beasts and helped protect them. These places were part of the Elyrion conservation corps. But where were all the unicorns? Usually these places were full of them. Had {{ she(Polan'il) }} been so distracted and scatter brained that {{ she(Polan'il) }} hadn’t noticed any of the flashy beasts?
A wave of fatigue washed over {{Polan'il}}. {{ She(Polan'il) }} lowered {{ herself(Polan'il) }} to the ground, drew up {{ herd(Polan'il) }} knees, and closed {{ herd(Polan'il) }} eyes.
***
The next day, hunger nudged {{ Polan'il }} awake. Harsh sunlight reflected off the crystal column making {{ her(Polan'il) }} blink. {{ She(Polan'il) }} followed the sound of gurgling to a small stream. {{ She(Polan'il) }} took a moment to slake {{ herd(Polan'il) }} thirst and wash away some of the grit from the previous day. The cold water felt good on {{ herd(Polan'il) }} skin, jolting {{ herd(Polan'il) }} senses awake. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had no food, but {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d be alright. By the end of the day, {{ she(Polan'il) }} would be at Polaris and could find help there.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} walked through the forest and soon came to an open field. Farms stretched into the green hills to the east and west. {{Polan'il}} could see a road in the distance. Pink shapes moved in a long line. 
Troops. Heading north.
{{Polan'il}}’s mind surged awake, the implications of the Elyrion army on route to Polaris, spiraling through {{ herd(Polan'il) }}. How many troops? What kind? Any weaknesses that could be exploited? This could be invaluable information. 
{{ She(Polan'il) }} started to move through the golden stalks of grain, then {{ she(Polan'il) }} paused. If {{ she(Polan'il) }} was spotted, {{ she(Polan'il) }} would be killed. {{ She(Polan'il) }} was no use to {{ herd(Polan'il) }} people dead. Then again, if {{ she(Polan'il) }} came home without anything to show for it except a broken peace treaty and a botched riot, {{ herd(Polan'il) }} commanders might throw {{ her(Polan'il) }} out of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} job, or worse. Guilt pressed down on {{ her(Polan'il) }} like a blanket of heavy snow. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had to redeem {{ herself(Polan'il) }}. {{ She(Polan'il) }}’d made so many mistakes, but maybe it wasn’t too late to fix what {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d broken. {{ She(Polan'il) }} needed to learn more and warn the Polaris commanders of the coming threat. 
{{Polan'il}}’s cloak turned a soft gold as {{ she(Polan'il) }} crept through the field. The sun was high overhead and sweat trickled down the small of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} back. {{ She(Polan'il) }} approached the road and counted troops. Three squads of riders, a group of knights. {{ She(Polan'il) }} swallowed down hard as {{ herd(Polan'il) }} gaze swept over the knights. What if {{Eren}} … ? But no. {{Eren}} was not in this group. {{ She(Polan'il) }} was sure. {{Polan'il}} could recognize {{Eren}}’s broad shoulders and confident frame anywhere. {{ Her(Polan'il) }} lover was not among this group. No. Former lover. 
 {{ She(Polan'il) }} forced the thought away. {{ She(Polan'il) }} would not think about {{Eren}} now, maybe not ever. Maybe…
Then a strange sight tore {{ herd(Polan'il) }} attention. Troops clad in Elyrion pink and walking in warrior formation, but not like any troops {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d seen before. They had the bodies and equipment of warriors with the heads of unicorns. How? What were these twisted monster soldiers?
A rider moving fast was galloping along the road to the front of the line of troops. {{Polan'il}} recognized the rider’s uniform. It was one of the squires, like the one who had delivered orders from the {{ Emperor }}. Determination gripped {{Polan'il}}. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had to know what news the squire was bringing.
{{Polan'il}} inched forward, careful to stay quiet and keep off the road, but within earshot of the Elyrion messenger.
A scratchy voice called out in Elyrion, “Report! What news from the capitol”
The squire saluted and replied, “{{ Sirr(Conner) }} {{Conner}} says the battle at ∑∑₼πo city went as expected. The bugs played  their part. Polaris was forced to break the peace. The city is safely back under Elyrion control. All is going to plan.” The squire handed the commander a scroll.
{{Polan'il}} crept forward, close enough to see the fish-faced commander perched in the saddle in front of the troops.
The commander scanned the orders then nodded. “Tell the {{Emperor}} that everything is on schedule. The eastern Polaris border has already fallen. More firepower is on its way.” 
The squire saluted, turned {{ herd(squire) }} mount around, and rode back the way {{ she(squire) }}’d come.
{{Polan'il}} darted back in the stalks of grain. 
Ice and Ashes, could that squire be right? The border had fallen? No. There is no way the Elyrion army could have moved that fast.
A blizzard of questions roared through {{ herd(Polan'il) }} mind. It was too much. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had to tell {{ herd(Polan'il) }} network what {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d learned and try to make sense of it all. {{ She(Polan'il) }} needed to get home to Polaris.

<h2>Chapter 18: Polaris</h2>
The sun was low on the horizon when {{Polan'il}}’s boots crunched snow. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had pushed {{ herself(Polan'il) }} to move fast across the Elyrion countryside, ignoring the hunger and thirst. The familiar chill on {{ herd(Polan'il) }} skin , the prickly cold in the air, was a relief, but it was not enough. {{Polan'il}} had to report to the Polaris spy network. 
The white domes of a Polaris town rose in the distance. Hope grew in {{Polan'il}}. {{ She(Polan'il) }} was almost safe. {{ She(Polan'il) }} turned {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak around, the smooth lining tucked inside, the bold fur lining framing {{ herd(Polan'il) }} face. {{ She(Polan'il) }} didn’t need to hide anymore.
***
Inside the command igloo, {{Polan'il}} sipped at a steaming mug of stew. The broth was like liquid relief, washing away {{ herd(Polan'il) }} weariness.
Ambassador {{Anpolta}} was next to {{ Polan'il }}, scribbling notes as {{Polan'il}} talked. When {{Anpolta}} had seen {{ her(Polan'il) }} at the door, trembling and alone, the ambassador had gathered {{Polan'il}} in {{ herd(Anpolta) }} ample arms, brought {{ her(Polan'il ) }} inside, and gotten {{ her(Polan'il ) }} something warm to drink. 
As {{Polan'il}} told {{ herd(Polan'il) }} story, {{ herd(Polan'il) }} old habits of observation kicked in. {{Anpolta}}’s eyes were dark with lack of sleep and worry. The ambassador looked as haggard as {{Polan'il}} felt.  The room was like all the other network stations, maps on the wall. But instead of scrolls and documents carefully arranged on shelves, the room was a mess of littered paper, half-eaten meals, and mud.
{{Anpolta}} looked up and asked, “Anything else about Cymanti? Did you see the shaman?” The {{ woman(Anpolta) }}’s hair stood up in all directions, as if it was made of tiny icles. {{ Herd(Anpolta) }} eyes were lined in red, weary from either lack of sleep or crying, or both.
{{Polan'il}} shook {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head and gripped {{ herd(Polan'il) }} mug. “No, no shaman. But the Elyrion commander said the bugs had done their part. It sounded like they had an arrangement with Cymanti. Could they have had an alliance?”
{{Anpolta}} stood up and looked at one of the maps on the wall. {{ She(Anpolta) }} shook {{ herd(Anpolta) }} head. “Impossible. The shaman would never …” {{Anpolta}} stopped {{ herself(Anpolta) }} then started again. {{ She(Anpolta) }} leaned down next to {{Polan'il}}. “Tell me again. You said the bugs were attacking the Elyrion troops and the centipede was destroying the city.”
“Yes, the centipede was devouring the people.”
{{Anpolta}} shook {{ herd(Anpolta) }} head again,“Precisely. You can’t have an alliance if one side is eating the other. The Cymanti are not allied with Elyrion.” 
{{Polan'il}} mused, “So Elyrion either had foreknowledge of the bug attack or somehow coordinated with Cymanti. But when I first approached the {{ Emperor }}, {{ he(Emperor ) }} didn’t want an alliance with us. {{ He(Emperor ) }} didn’t see the bugs as a threat.” 
“The commander must have been lying. My reports say Elyrion has dozens of squads of riders, warriors, and knights, not to mention these half-unicorn monster soldiers.” 
“Yes, I saw those hybrid troops. What are they?”
“Some kind of twisted perversion of a unicorn. Very strong. We don’t know how they got so many so fast.”
{{Polan'il}} remembered the crystal pillar from sanctuary yesterday and how strange it had been not to see any unicorns around it. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} words tumbled out, “From the sanctuaries. The {{ Emperor }} has been breeding unicorns there for a long time. They used to be teeming with unicorns. Yesterday, when I passed through one, it was empty.” 
{{Anpolta}} traced a line on the map from the Elyrion capital to the city. “How could the {{ Emperor }} have gotten {{ hisd(Emperor ) }} forces in place so quickly? You said a squire sent a message to the knight you were traveling with with orders to defend the city. But the {{ Emperor }} and {{ hisd(Emperor ) }} forces arrived shortly after you did.”
“Yes, and {{Eren}}’s orders said to leave me behind. They wanted {{Eren}} there, but not me. Why?” {{Polan'il}} closed {{ herd(Polan'il) }} eyes, repeating the words the squire had said to the Elyrion commander, “Polaris was forced to break the peace.” 
{{Anpolta}} said, “It sounds like Elyrion had the same idea we did, use the pretense of an alliance to build up an army, buy some time to maneuver, then break the peace when it was convenient. Smart {{ bastard(Emperor) }}.” 
“Yes, but more than that, it is about justification. If it looks like Polaris broke faith and betrayed the peace, {{Conner}} can use that excuse to hunt down and kill all the Polaris forces in {{ hisd(Conner) }} borders. It makes us look like villains.” Anger coursed through {{Polan'il}}, “Ice and Ashes, why didn’t we plan for this? How did we not see this coming?”
{{Anpolta}} shook {{ herd(Anpolta) }} head spiky hair bristling, but didn’t answer.
{{Polan'il}} looked at the largest map. Each Polaris city, the natural resources, and outposts were marked with different symbols. A large X was slashed through the symbol for the Polaris capital.
“Is the capital really gone?” {{Polan'il}} asked, a shiver shaking {{ herd(Polan'il) }}. {{ She(Polan'il) }} closed {{ herd(Polan'il) }} eyes and took another gulp of stew, letting the warm liquid settle {{ herd(Polan'il) }} nerves.
“I’m afraid so.” {{Anpolta}} sighed. “Word came early this morning. They came at us from the Oolian shore. Broke all the ice and sent a sea monster to devour our troops. Our Gaami got there, but it was too late.”
Even the Gaami couldn’t stop the Elyrion.
{{Polan'il}} took another sip from the mug. As the warm broth coursed through {{ her(Polan'il) }}, the cold resolve that had been keeping {{ her(Polan'il) }} strong melted. The memory of the centipede devouring the Polaris agent, the long line of Elyrion troops on the road north, the look in {{Eren}}’s eyes when {{ she(Eren) }} told {{Polan'il}} to leave. It was all too much. Tears trailed down {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cheeks. 
{{Anpolta}} sat down beside {{Polan'il}} and placed a gentle hand on {{ herd(Polan'il) }} shoulder. “We’ve lost a lot of good people but it isn’t over yet. We have another Gaami and squads of archers. The ice is still strong. Also, I have some contacts, outside of Polaris, who may be able to help.” 
{{Polan'il}} sat up straight. “Outside of Polaris?”
{{Anpolta}} let out a sigh, “Yes. I am an ambassador after all. I cannot say more now. Just trust me on this.” 
“But who…”
{{Anpolta}} cut {{ herd(Polan'il) }} off, “There is something I don’t understand. You said that {{Conner}} said something about firepower. What do you think that meant?”
{{Polan'il}} brushed away {{ herd(Polan'il) }} tears. “I have no idea.”
A roar from above shook the room. Cries of alarm followed. Dread coursed through {{Polan'il}}.
“I think we’re about to find out.”

<h2>Chapter 19: Fire and Ice</h2>
{{Polan'il}} followed {{Anpolta}} out of the command igloo. They stood in the doorway. Polaris agents rushed in all directions, shouting, grabbing weapons, and scrambling to their stations. A crash shook the city, followed by screams. Flames shot up in the distance. It sounded just like the Elyrion city under siege. {{Polan'il}}’s mind flashed with memories of the giant centipede smashing through buildings.
No, not again. 
{{Anpolta}} shouted, “Look there!” and pointed to the sky.
A shadow whooshed past followed by an explosion of fire.
{{Polan'il}} looked up. A bright pink monster with bat-like wings, a serpentine tail, and the head of a lizard spat fire at a squad of Polaris warriors, instantly covering them and the surrounding buildings in fire. 
“Eternal Ice! A dragon!” {{Anpolta}} exclaimed. 
“Quick, flip your cloak.” {{Polan'il}} shouted. 
{{ She(Polan'il) }} was already reversing the furred lining and slipping the reflective side of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak around. 
{{Anpolta}} fumbled with {{ herd(Anpolta) }} garment. A pulse of hot air tore at the cloth as a shadow passed over head.  {{ She(Anpolta) }} dropped the slippery cloth on the icy ground. 
“Come on!” {{Polan'il}} urged, moving for the city wall.
{{Anpolta}} knelt down for {{ herd(Anpolta) }} cloak, plump fingers fumbling with the ties. 
A massive beast wearing a pink uniform charged down the street. It had the head of a unicorn, the body of a soldier, and the roar of a killer. 
{{Polan'il}} stepped back inside the igloo, careful to keep {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak on tight. “{{Anpolta}}, watch out!”
{{Anpolta}} looked up, but {{ she(Anpolta) }} was too slow. The creature slammed into the ambassador. {{Anpolta}} cried out in pain as a gush of blood shot out of the {{ woman(Anpolta) }}’s side. {{ She(Anpolta) }} fell to {{ herd(Anpolta) }} knees, then slumped against the door frame.
The unicorn soldier drew back, blood dripping from the horn on its forehead. It roared in triumph.
Another wave of heat and light pulsed somewhere behind. The crash of ice mixed with screams. Smoke shot into the air. 
A second hybrid soldier appeared from the haze in the street, but it was not like the half-unicorn soldier. This monster had the torso of a bug and wore the uniform of an Elyrion. 
How did the Elyrion have Cymanti creatures in their army? It made no sense. The two tribes couldn't have an alliance. {{Anpolta}} had said so. {{Polan'il}} had no time to puzzle it out. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had to stay alive.
{{Polan'il}} shrank back, {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak keeping {{ her(Polan'il) }} invisible. {{ She(Polan'il) }} glanced around, scanning for help.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} saw a squad of archers taking position on the top of the command igloo. {{Polan'il}} took a risk and shouted in Polarisi, “Help! Down here. The ambassador needs help.”
The two hybrids heard and turned in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} direction. Luckily, the archers had also heard {{ her(Polan'il) }}. A volley of blue-white arrows slammed into the soldier beasts, freezing them with their ice magic.
{{Anpolta}} moaned. Blood puddled in the shimmering cloak fabric at {{ herd(Anpolta) }} feet.
{{Polan'il}} knelt down, cradling {{Anpolta}} against {{ herd(Polan'il) }} body. Tears streamed down {{Polan'il}}’s face. “No, no, no. This cannot be happening. Please {{Anpolta}}”
“Find the Shaman,” {{Anpolta}} rasped.
{{Polan'il}} fought back tears. “The Cymanti leader? How? Where?”
“Follow the fungus. Find the Shaman. Tell Cylu I sent you.” Then {{Anpolta}} went still.
Shouts and roars mingled with screams of pain. Another volley of arrows flew overhead. The acrid smell of smoke made {{Polan'il}} cough. 
It was all too much. {{Polan'il}} couldn’t think. All {{ she(Polan'il) }} felt sadness and rage. 
{{Anpolta}}’s words echoed in {{ herd(Polan'il) }} brain. ‘Follow the fungus. Find the Shaman’ 
{{Polan'il}} released the ambassador and stood, {{ herd(Anpolta) }} cloak reflecting the sudden eruptions of fire. 
Then, {{ she(Polan'il) }} ran for the city gates. 

<h2>Chapter 20: Cymanti</h2>
Trees bumped into {{ her(Polan'il) }}. A stream soaked {{ herd(Polan'il) }} boots. The sky pressed down.
{{Polan'il}} kept moving.
{{Polan'il}} ran, then walked, then crawled.
Finally {{ she(Polan'il) }} collapsed in a dark thicket of oaks. A glimpse of pink spiked {{ herd(Polan'il) }} panic.Then it drained away as {{ she(Polan'il) }} realized it wasn’t the bright pink of Elyrion armor, but the dusty rose of fungus.
Follow the fungus. Find the Shaman.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} coughed. The poisonous spores descended into {{ herd(Polan'il) }} lungs.
{{Polan'il}} did not care anymore.
{{ She(Polan'il) }}’d lost everything, the peace, {{Eren}}, and all of Polaris. It did not matter how many schemes {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d come up with, how attentive {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d been to details, or how diligent {{ herd(Polan'il) }} reporting had been. All {{ herd(Polan'il) }} plans had been for nothing. And now {{ she(Polan'il) }} had no plan, no hope, only some vague instructions from {{Anpolta}}.
Maybe that had been {{ herd(Polan'il) }} problem all along, too much planning. {{ She(Polan'il) }} thought of {{Eren}}, so carefree and easy going. {{ She(Eren) }} never planned anything. If a good idea struck {{ her(Eren) }}, {{Eren}} acted. {{Polan'il}} remembered {{Eren}}’s laugh, {{ herd(Eren) }} honesty, {{ herd(Eren) }} touch.
All gone.
In {{ herd(Polan'il) }} pocket, {{Polan'il}} fingered the glove that {{Eren}} had given {{ her(Polan'il) }}. {{Eren}} had called it {{ herd(Eren) }} lucky glove. The leather was smooth and warm. {{ She(Polan'il) }} traced the stitching along the seam, like a path leading {{ herd(Polan'il) }} fingertip forward. {{ She(NAPolan'ilME) }} slipped the fingerless glove onto {{ herd(Polan'il) }} hand, letting the supple leather envelope {{ herd(Polan'il) }} skin.
Shadows crept across the groove. {{Polan'il}} felt nauseous. The poison mingled with {{ herd(Polan'il) }} grief.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} heard the rustle of leaves. Twigs snapping. Then chittering.
{{Polan'il}} couldn’t help it. On instinct, {{ she(Polan'il) }} lifted {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head, curious.
A hexapod moved into the clearing. It headed right for {{ her(Polan'il) }}. {{ She(Polan'il) }} was still invisible, {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak reflecting the lush oak leaves. If {{ she(Polan'il) }} rolled aside, it might avoid {{ her(Polan'il) }}. But {{ she(Polan'il) }} didn’t have the energy or the will power to move.
The large bug stepped on {{ her(Polan'il) }}, its sharp appendage piercing {{ herd(Polan'il) }} cloak, revealing {{ her(Polan'il) }}. The hexapod’s mandibles twitched in surprise. It clacked and chittered. 
For a long while, the bug was still. Why? The creature knew {{ she(Polan'il) }} was there. Why wasn’t it attacking {{ her(Polan'il) }}?
Then, a person in dark robes and an oversized helmet strode into the glen. {{ They(Cylu) }} used a staff to steady {{ them(Cylu) }} as {{ they(Cylu) }} picked {{ their(Cylu) }} way through the trees. 
Wait. No. Not a helmet. A bug. A large green bug perched on the person’s head with a pair of oversized compound eyes that glittered in the moonlight. A Cymanti.
The person spoke, and a slow, practiced voice swept over {{ herd(Cylu) }}, almost like a chant. “Do not fear. You have been blessed with a second chance.”
The Cymanti stretched a staff crowned with the skull of a hexapod and continued the chant. “Come with us. We can make you whole and give you a new purpose.”
{{Polan'il}} glanced at the hexapod, its sharp mandibles were only inches away. Then a new idea struck {{ herd(Polan'il) }}, as sharp and cold as an ice arrow. This Cymanti had spoken Polarisi. This person knew {{ herd(Polan'il) }} language.
Not just any Cymanti. The Shaman.
{{ She(Polan'il) }} looked carefully at the robed Cymanti. “Do you know {{Anpolta}}?”
The shaman stretched out a hand. Not an insect appendage or a monster’s claw, but a normal hand, firm and warm, like any other hand. “Yes, {{Anpolta}} is well known to us. Come.” The shaman repeated.
{{Polan'il}} thought of {{Eren}}. What would {{ she(Eren) }} do in this situation?
{{Polan'il}} swallowed down {{ herd(Polan'il) }} doubt and reached out. {{ She(Polan'il) }} took the Shaman’s hand and got to {{ herd(Polan'il) }} feet.

<h2>Chapter 21: New plans</h2>
It took many days for {{Polan'il}} to heal and adjust to the Cymnati symbiotic connection.
{{Polan'il}} saw the world in a new way. The bug that wrapped over {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head allowed {{ her(Polan'il) }} to see what the bug saw and hear what the bug heard. Not only did the ciru bug symbiosis give {{ her(Polan'il) }} kaleidoscopic vision, the integration with the Cymanti people connected {{ her(Polan'il) }} with others in a way {{ she(Polan'il) }} never knew was possible. By accepting the bug on {{ herd(Polan'il) }} body, {{ she(Polan'il) }} was also accepting their community and they accepted Polan'il. The Cymanti were a collective, all working together for the good of the group. The shaman was selfless, using {{ hisd(Cylu) }} powers to strengthen others, never {{ himself(Cylu) }}. Even the Cymanti language reflected their communal approach.
The shaman, {{Cylu}}, visited Polan'il as {{ she(Polan'il) }} convalesced. “How are we feeling today?” {{ He(Cylu) }} handed {{ her(Polan'il) }} a platter of baked tubers and soft rice.
{{Polan'il}} sat up, took the food, and inhaled the earthy aroma, “I’m better…” 
{{ She(Polan'il) }} paused. A niggling at the base of {{ herd(Polan'il) }} skull corrected {{ herd(Polan'il) }} words. “Yes, um. We are doing better,” {{Polan'il}} amended. {{ She(Polan'il) }} kept forgetting not to use the word “I.”
{{Polan'il}} lay on a reed mat near the back of the large round room. The shaman’s home was made of broad fibrous walls, salvaged stone, and woven planks, giving the structure a bulbous, wave-like feeling. Since the ciru bug’s eyes could easily see in the dark, there were no lanterns or other sources of light, only a central heath fire for cooking and warmth. It smelled of damp mulch and fresh cut grass. 
The space was constantly busy, with bugs and people flowing in and out. To {{ her(Polan'il) }}, the place seemed noisy. The Cymanti bugs’ chitters and clacks were nonstop, although now, with {{ herd(Polan'il) }} modified senses, their pattern of mandible percussion noises sounded more like a song, its rhythm deliberate and uplifting. The space was less of a home for the Shaman and more the heart of the community, beating with a rhythm.
The Shaman sat beside {{Polan'il}}, {{ hisd(Cylu) }} staff across {{ hisd(Cylu) }} lap. “That is good to hear. Your people have been through so much pain and loss. It is unimaginable.”
“Is there anything left of Polaris?” {{Polan'il}}’s voice faltered and {{ she(Polan'il) }} swallowed hard.
“All the ice lands have been taken. Most by the unicorn people, but we managed to claim two snow cities in the east. We have saved many lives and redeemed others, just as we have with you.”
{{Polan'il}} shook {{ herd(Polan'il) }} head. “How could I have been so blind? The Elyrion were planning to invade Polaris all along.”
“Their leader manipulated us too. For many seasons, the unicorn riders have spread over our lands, expanding their borders and claiming villages that were in Cymanti territory. {{ They gave us trinkets, colorful fabrics, and platitudes. When they took our fungus forests in the name of nature conservation, we had a different word for what they were doing - theft.”
{{Polan'il}} remembered the fungus {{ she(Polan'il) }}’d seen in the new Elyrion sanctuary. At the time, {{ she(Polan'il) }} had thought the Cymanti were invading Elyrion lands. But no. It had been the other way around. The Elyrion were taking over Cymanti lands. That’s why there had been no unicorns there.
What else had the Eylrion lied about?
 {{ She(Polan'il) }} thought out loud,“The knight I was traveling with got a message with instructions to keep me away from the city under siege. But the commander knew I’d read it. {{ He(Conner) }} knew if I read, ‘keep the spy away’ I would be compelled to go. {{Conner}} must have wanted Polaris there when Cymanti attacked, to blame us and use it as an excuse to break the peace.” 
The shaman hummed a bit, {{ hisd(Cylu) }} voice vibrating. “We were led to believe that the Elyrion city was undefended, ripe for the plucking. It was a trap, for both our tribes.”
{{Polan'il}} listened to the rhythm of the Cymanti workers. The beat was both irregular and constant like the patter of rain or the rush of the wind, strong and uplifting. {{ She(Polan'il) }} had lost so much, but not everything. {{ She(Polan'il) }}’d been given a second chance and {{ she(Polan'il) }} wasn’t going to waste it. 
{{Polan'il}} looked at the Shaman, compound eyes reflecting the soft glow from the hearth. “What now? I want to help.”
“Good.” The Shaman stood and nodded. “Our people have an expression: Grubs can grow into butterflies. Spoons can be forged into spears.” {{ He(Cylu) }} pointed {{ hisd(Cylu) }} staff towards an arch. “Let us show you something.”
{{Polan'il}} stood and followed the Shaman outside, then to another bulbous structure. Inside were several other Cymanti standing around a large table talking rapidly. Maps were pinned to the walls. Cupboards were jammed with papers. {{Polan'il}} immediately recognized the space for what it was, a strategy center. 
One of the agents pointed to a spot on the map and said, “Reports from the south say a juvenile dragon. That has to be our priority.”
Another replied, “We can spare two hexapods from the delta squad.”
{{Polan'il}} smiled. {{ She(Polan'il) }} knew this type of tactical talk. For the first time, this place felt like home.
The Shaman tapped {{ hisd(Cylu) }} staff and Cymanti strategists spun around, “Apologies for the interruption, but we have a new asset, a former spy from the fallen ice lands, who wants to help.”
{{Polan'il}} looked at the map. {{ Herd(Polan'il) }} mind started to whirl, ideas and plans spinning, like a web taking shape.
