Each morning, for about four months now, I am woken by the same foul, fat pigeon. I am certain that {{ he(pigeon) }}’s the same one, even though I have no means to prove it. In truth, I have no way to be sure {{ he(pigeon) }} is a {{ he(pigeon) }} either. It used to occur to me that maybe {{ he(pigeon) }} had left something at the window or inside, and was hoping that being here to retrieve it would allow {{ him(pigeon) }} some sort of release. On most Saturdays, I leave the window open. It makes me feel kind, because I am easing {{ hisd(pigeon) }} spirit into the next phase or something of that nature. {{ He(pigeon) }} never comes in, though, and so we converse silently about what it is {{ he(pigeon) }} might want or why, of all the places on earth, {{ he(pigeon) }} would choose to be here.
I’ve not given {{ him(pigeon) }} a name, because I don’t want to become too attached. {{ He(pigeon) }} will leave, and I will have developed some form of a relationship which is all in my head. Instead, {{ he(pigeon) }} is named pigeon, or when {{ he(pigeon) }} is the subject of conversation, which {{ he(pigeon) }} often is, the pigeon. {{ He(pigeon) }} has a very brutal-seeming face, but the sound of {{ hisd(pigeon) }} brooding is actually quite tender. I did ask the SPCA to come round and make sure there was not a broken wing preventing {{ him(pigeon) }} from flying away. The {{ woman(SPCA) }} on the other end, obviously older, told me that they are unable to rescue pigeons, so I would need to bring {{ him(pigeon) }} in. This led me, on one open-windowed Saturday, to climb out onto the fire escape with a bucket and a vegetable steamer, the kind that is silver and peppered with holes for draining. I searched for {{ him(pigeon) }} for a good six or seven minutes, the dryness of the day creeping into my eyes and nose. It was the pigeon {{ himself(pigeon) }} who alerted me to {{ hisd(pigeon) }} whereabouts. I heard that unmistakeable ruffling noise somewhere above my head, like an old man waking up and shuffling towards the toilet for his first morning piss. Slowly, I approached {{ him(pigeon) }}. I assumed that, by now, {{ he(pigeon) }} was aware that I was not trying to hurt {{ him(pigeon) }}. {{ He(pigeon) }} didn’t mind me approaching, but fluttered away once I tried to make use of my makeshift birdcage. I watched to see if there was any struggle or strain, or if {{ he(pigeon) }} was lopsided when in flight, but {{ he(pigeon) }} was perfectly fine, deftly traversing through the air, carrying {{ hisd(pigeon) }} considerable weight along without any disquiet.
The pigeon and I have a very warm and comfortable relationship. It feels intimate, but I do realise that {{ he(pigeon) }} has never actually had occasion to tell me anything about {{ himself(pigeon) }}. In truth, {{ he(pigeon) }} knows everything there is to know about me, and I know very little about {{ him(pigeon) }}. {{ Hisd(pigeon) }} elliptic eyes are only opaque, and I sometimes wish I could ask {{ him(pigeon) }} if {{ he(pigeon) }} was born with that crease at the back of {{ hisd(pigeon) }} head or if it’s the result of some or other misadventure. On a particularly irresponsible day, after a really bad argument with {{Jasmine}}, I shared some of my rum with {{ him(pigeon) }}. It felt funny at the time, but now I can see it was cruel. {{ He(pigeon) }} did nudge {{ hisd(pigeon) }} head towards the bottom half of an old lunchbox that someone else had already left on the fire escape. {{ He(pigeon) }} pecked the liquid and it rippled uneasily. {{ He(pigeon) }} seemed to be sniffing it but I’m not sure how much a pigeon can smell. Anyway, {{ he(pigeon) }} chose not to drink with me that day and I must admit that I felt a little rejected. {{ He(pigeon) }} actually flew away altogether, largesse in tow, and I was left utterly alone.
I remember the burning sensation of the rum that day, plummeting down my gullet and leaving in its wake poking, prodding awakenings along the tunnel that led to my belly. Slowly, these dulled and became festering singes that reminded me from the inside out how sore I was. Not in all the places of my body, but certainly in the parts where it mattered. {{Jasmine}} and I had been collecting unkind words to say to each other. I could see them, over the preceding days, settling on the tips of {{ herd(Jasmine) }} pink lips ready to be deployed in angry flight. What started as a rather innocuous disagreement about the fan slowly inched closer and closer towards a fight, the kind of fight that you build up defences to avoid but somehow find happening. It happens slowly, because the defences are too difficult to keep standing upright. Little by little, you witness the tops of them desiccate and then erode.
More than anything, I think I hated that the newness and sublime illicitness of our affair was slowly dissipating. We were starting to know each other in ways that felt familiar, and I would have preferred that we didn’t. I wanted {{ herd(Jasmine) }} vague and nameless insecurities to remain vague and nameless. Gradually they revealed themselves in moments of vulnerability or congress. I started to find names for them, like timidity and callousness. Even the ripeness of {{ herd(Jasmine) }} body was starting to feel mundane. I realised, just yesterday, that I could tell you the exact shape of the tiny black stripes that emerged from the centres of {{ herd(Jasmine) }} grey eyes, and how they rippled when {{ herd(Jasmine) }} eyes widened with ecstasy.

I don’t know how it happened, because we were both extremely cautious about the idea of growing too close to each other. It was a risk that neither of us wanted to take, particularly now that {{ she(Jasmine) }} was engaged. What was worse, I think, was that {{ she(Jasmine) }} meant it. {{ She(Jasmine) }} wanted to be married, and I wanted {{ her(Jasmine) }} to have whatever {{ she(Jasmine) }} wanted for {{ herself(Jasmine) }}. They were perfect for each other – {{ herd(Jasmine) }} long droopy hair matched {{ hisd(Nathan) }} perfect cheekbones. But the pigeon will attest that it drove me to distraction. {{ He(pigeon) }} has seen me agonise with guilt and genuine concern about the pain I would be causing {{Nathan}}, whose friendship was one of the last residues of my childhood that I actually wanted to preserve. {{ He(pigeon) }}, the pigeon that is, watched, with {{ hisd(pigeon) }} sharp eyes, as I rationalised my way into and out of the affair with {{Jasmine}}. I recognise that there is no way to know for sure, but it felt as though {{ he(pigeon) }} understood and did not judge me.
Come to think of it, it was only seven or eight days after {{Nathan}}’s accident, which coincided with the start of our affair, that the pigeon arrived, as if {{ he(pigeon) }} knew that I needed {{ him(pigeon) }} to bear witness to my self-indulgences, or just that I needed a friend. The first few days were especially torturous. Ever since I walked {{Jasmine}} to my place from the hospital, and ripped the stained {{ dress(Jasmine) }} off of {{ her(Jasmine) }}, bundling {{ her(Jasmine) }} into the shower where {{ she(Jasmine) }} sat naked as {{Nathan}}’s blood and {{ hers(Jasmine) }} mingled with the hot water and disappeared down the drain, we struggled with the fact that we needed comfort. That we found it in each other sullied it, but didn’t stop it from happening.
They had been away for a long weekend. Travelling back on {{ hisd(Nathan) }} motorcycle at night, neither of them could see the ridge in the road. {{Jasmine}} told the story to me as if {{ she(Jasmine) }} was reliving it, but it was worse because the end was really only the beginning. When I found {{ her(Jasmine) }}, trembling and mumbling to {{ herself(Jasmine) }}, it seemed difficult to maintain any sense of dignity about {{ her(Jasmine) }}. The blood and urine on {{ herd(Jasmine) }} {{ dress(Jasmine) }} made {{ her(Jasmine) }} look like a frightened child, and the story {{ she(Jasmine) }} told was filled with fear and need and desperation. For an hour, probably, I sat with {{ her(Jasmine) }} while they finished the last of {{ herd(Jasmine) }} stitches. We left the hospital as the man in navy blue overalls said that {{Nathan}} was in a coma, and they would be keeping {{ him(Nathan) }} over the next few days.
 
It sounded like the most unlikely of possibilities. Even now, it seems like an alternative reality when I think about the chaos of that evening, about {{Jasmine}} heaving in bed as I listened from the sofa. It was the only thing I could hear, the rest just stillness and chilled vacantness. We were on the fifth floor of a six storey building, and I don’t think anyone was upstairs or down. It was just us and the mortar which seals all the heaviness in. Anyway, we both needed it, to be held and fucked. It was a jittery, disconcerting kind of fuck, filled with awkward hesitation. I’ve never fucked my {{ sister(Jasmine) }}, but I imagine that the trepidation would be similar, voices slowly jutting out for breath and bodies carefully intertwining until they can’t be forced apart. I remember tingling and shivering and writhing and, when it was over, we knew it would be happening again.
For a few days, we hovered around each other at the hospital, the sound of {{Nathan}}’s steady heartbeat and the smell of industrial bleach shared between us in the absence of words to speak or thoughts to share. {{ She(Jasmine) }} struggled more than I did, because {{ she(Jasmine) }} had said yes that weekend. I now realise that {{ she(Jasmine) }} was not sure which of {{ herd(Jasmine) }} actions were mistakes or miscalculations. {{ She(Jasmine) }} was – is – the type of person who regrets everything.
Roughly a week after the accident, the yellow and blue bruises on {{Jasmine}}’s legs and arms and neck were starting to fade. As they receded, {{ herd(Jasmine) }} contrition multiplied. {{ She(Jasmine) }} was living and breathing and healing without {{ him(Nathan) }}. {{ Herd(Jasmine) }} swollen right eye wasn’t throbbing enough to cause {{ her(Jasmine) }} pain and the quivering in {{ herd(Jasmine) }} tiny hands no longer seemed so shaky. {{ She(Jasmine) }} kept two or three fingernails dirty, as if holding on to the freshness of the night, but each time we saw each other, {{ she(Jasmine) }} started to look more like {{ herself(Jasmine) }} again, hair neatly swept up and neck adorned with the gold heart pendant {{ she(Jasmine) }} was wearing the first time I met {{ her(Jasmine) }}.

We edged towards repeating what had happened that night, and somewhere along the line we stopped fighting it. It was a Saturday evening, breezy but not cold. Under some feeble pretence about wanting to talk about the last time we slipped into each other, we decided that {{ she(Jasmine) }} should come over for tea. {{Jasmine}} likes {{ herd(Jasmine) }} tea almost perfectly white, {{ she(Jasmine) }} sips it with thought and consideration. I prefer the strong, bitter kind, which meant having to walk to the superette to buy milk. {{ She(Jasmine) }} likes the two per cent. I know this because of the fight they had when {{Nathan}}’s {{ brother(Isaac) }} {{Isaac}} came to visit and, like a narcissistic and invincible nineteen-year-old, {{ he(Isaac) }} would open a new bottle before finishing the old one. It made very little sense practically but there was no real fear in {{Isaac}} that things might go bad or lose their freshness. It drove {{Jasmine}} mad but didn’t really bother {{Nathan}} at all, and {{ she(Jasmine) }} raged at {{ hisd(Nathan) }} permissiveness in {{ herd(Jasmine) }} soft, merciless way until there was a more tangible, more intelligent, adult reason to be angry. {{ Herd(Jasmine) }} opportunity came when {{Isaac}} made a comment about Boko Haram that somehow sounded to {{ her(Jasmine) }} like a justification of their actions. Funny, thinking back, how quickly the ugliness started and how long it seemed to last. Somewhere in the mess, the two per cent had become important enough to bear mentioning and, as I walked, I remembered its significance, like the beacon around which all of the other tumult had docked.
I carried the heavy bottle in full knowledge that our charade would only be prolonged through tea and guilt and loyalty. Still, it evaporated more slowly than I think either of us expected. As I approached my building, I caught {{ her(Jasmine) }} walking towards it from the other direction. We were neither eager nor casual. I showed {{ her(Jasmine) }} the bottle and {{ she(Jasmine) }} quickly remembered how I knew about it. We left the subject hanging silently, like an unwanted grape on a long and convoluted vine.
‘I don’t know if I’m imagining it, but it felt like {{ he(Nathan) }} was trying to squeeze my hand today.’
It was the safest of topics and I nodded knowingly, without entering into the ridiculousness of {{ herd(Jasmine) }} presumption.
‘Have you been sleeping?’
‘Not consistently, but it’s getting better. I haven’t dreamt about it for the past two nights.’
Pensive silences were interrupted with dull practicalities, like {{ herd(Jasmine) }} X-ray results and conversations with {{Nathan}}’s boss, which were only to be quickly dismissed.
It was a surprise when {{Jasmine}} initiated the conversation {{ she(Jasmine) }} was there to have. {{ She(Jasmine) }} started just by saying that it was ‘rather a mistake’.
‘I really do not want any of this to disrupt {{Nathan}}’s recovery.’ {{ She(Jasmine) }} was making it easy for both of us. It wasn’t even clear that there was to be a recovery, but still.
‘I know.’
‘I’m not exactly sure what it means or why it happened . . . I think I was just, we were just . . .’
‘It was probably just shock or trauma or something. I wouldn’t think too much about what it meant,’ I said, rescuing {{ her(Jasmine) }} from painful remonstrations.
‘I can’t do it again,’ {{ she(Jasmine) }} said to me, earnestly. I didn’t respond, but knew it was bullshit.
‘Have you heard back about MSF?’ It had taken {{ her(Jasmine) }} about two minutes to search for absolutely anything else to talk about.
‘The envelope is right there . . .’ I said, pointing to the breakfast table ‘. . . I’m just not ready to open it.’
‘What are you hoping it says?’
I didn’t have a response for {{ her(Jasmine) }}. I wanted a change, a shift from this vacuum. I felt my body screaming for it, but I would have to be prepared for nothing to change and I couldn’t fool myself any more than I could fool {{ her(Jasmine) }}.
Not deliberately, my eyes shifted to {{ herd(Jasmine) }} naked knees, one perfectly formed, brown and soft and characterful and the other ugly and brutalised, like the branch of a tree that no longer stood healthily in the earth. {{ She(Jasmine) }} could see me looking, but I could not not look.
‘I hope it’s good news,’ {{ she(Jasmine) }} said, shifting {{ herd(Jasmine) }} legs as if I was molesting {{ her(Jasmine) }}. It made me turn around and walk toward the window so we could have almost the entire room between us. It wasn’t very big, but, in my careful and possibly unkind way, it seemed like {{ she(Jasmine) }} might feel safer if the dim light and the stale air occupied all of the space that separated us, if I could get no further away than I was right then.
‘I hope I get over it if it’s not.’
‘You’ll just have to make peace with being here, right?’
 
I remember feeling a little offended at how banal {{ she(Jasmine) }} seemed to find my inertia. It seemed insensitive to me that {{Jasmine}} would presume {{ she(Jasmine) }} understood my need for escape and newness, but we did, in some ways, witness each other in extraordinary ways. I didn’t say anything because I was unsure how to convey the seriousness with which I viewed my crisis. I think, also, because I would have been too wounded had {{ she(Jasmine) }} not properly understood it and, at the time, there really was no space for pain or anxiety that was separate from the accident or the events that followed directly after it. I did feel a little cruel though, and bluntly told {{ her(Jasmine) }} that I wouldn’t tell {{Nathan}} anything, that {{ she(Jasmine) }} didn’t need to be concerned about {{ him(Nathan) }} finding out, that it would be our secret. Ironically, that was the assurance {{ she(Jasmine) }} needed to allow {{ herself(Jasmine) }} to do it again.
We weren’t quick or uncomfortable this time. {{ She(Jasmine) }} began to tell me about how difficult it was to be alone and about how there were always leftovers because, after having lived with {{Nathan}} for a year, {{ she(Jasmine) }} seemed to have lost the ability to cook for one. It lightened the night, because it really did seem to be the stupidest of concerns, and I couldn’t help but laugh. {{ She(Jasmine) }} even seemed to understand why.
‘Do you think {{ he(Nathan) }}’s going to wake up?’ There was a proper sense of despair in the question. Up until then, we hadn’t really addressed the possibility that {{ he(Nathan) }} might actually die or vegetate. It was simply a question of how bad it would be when {{ he(Nathan) }} woke up. Would {{ he(Nathan) }} be depressed about the amputated leg? Would {{ he(Nathan) }} have any memory loss or need cognitive rehabilitation? The realm of possibility did not, in even its widest reaches, include the possibility that {{Nathan}} could actually die.
I didn’t want to offer any false hope. I offered wine instead – cheap Chardonnay that no one wanted, ever, except maybe at that moment. The rest was fast and irresponsible, like a chase through a forest littered with prickly barbs, each of us determined to end with a conquest no matter the cost. It was soft and textured at the end, because we were starting to understand how the other liked to be fucked. The pendant bobbed up and down as {{ herd(Jasmine) }} chest undulated while I stood behind {{ her(Jasmine) }}. {{ She(Jasmine) }} had no idea but I was, for some bizarre reason, fixated on the pigeon’s stark eyes.
{{ He(pigeon) }} waited for {{ her(Jasmine) }} to leave, angst-ridden and torn up by {{ herd(Jasmine) }} own regret, and then sat with me over tea, bearing witness to the fact that I was no longer ashamed. What shards of guilt still remained were blunting, and {{ he(pigeon) }} didn’t mind that they barely pierced my skin anymore.

That seems like forever ago now. Over time, I have learnt the shape of every cleft on {{Jasmine}}’s body, and have come to understand every moan, grunt, stare and laugh for the finitude with which they are intended. {{Nathan}}’s awakening was a gruelling three days. They slowly removed the pipes and assessed {{ hisd(Nathan) }} functioning. {{ Hisd(Nathan) }} hands trembled and {{ hisd(Nathan) }} face contorted with fear at the thought of living again, the light of day inching at {{ him(Nathan) }} like an unwelcome invader. I have known {{Nathan}} for almost twenty years, admired {{ hisd(Nathan) }} deftness and envied {{ hisd(Nathan) }} indestructibility, but witnessing a one-legged waif occupy {{ hisd(Nathan) }} body made {{ him(Nathan) }} strange and grotesque.
Hobbling was a farcical struggle for {{Nathan}}, and, in the same way an infant falls back on crawling, {{ he(Nathan) }} would rely on the crutch rather than walk on {{ hisd(Nathan) }} new leg. {{Jasmine}} and I slowly convinced {{ him(Nathan) }} to walk the lanes with us, having {{ him(Nathan) }} huddle between us, one arm wrapped around me, the other around {{ her(Jasmine) }}, stumbling like a petrified three-headed monster. I could see the guilt and shame curdle in {{ herd(Jasmine) }} face, but it disappeared when {{ he(Nathan) }} wasn’t between us. Rather than make sense of our guilt, we would drown it in liquor and then simply wait for sex to unravel itself. {{ She(Jasmine) }} often threatens to run, {{Jasmine}}, telling me most times that it will be the last time and then launching ugly, blaming attacks at me when it isn’t. I don’t mind, so I never struggle against the accusations, but I worry sometimes that {{ herd(Jasmine) }} soft violence will not fade with time.
It’s less comfortable leaving the window open for the pigeon these days. The chill has slowly undone the stubborn heat, so there is only a slight opening that filters in a hint of noise from outside. Occasionally, {{ he(pigeon) }} sticks {{ hisd(pigeon) }} beak in, but if I invite {{ him(pigeon) }} in or encourage {{ him(pigeon) }} any further {{ he(pigeon) }} disappears, flitting from the fire escape to the bedroom ledge or away into the street. I have learnt to keep my distance and not crowd {{ him(pigeon) }}, lest I lose {{ him(pigeon) }} altogether.

Today is {{Nathan}}’s birthday, which we’ve taken to calling {{ hisd(Nathan) }} second first birthday. I ready myself for the dinner party {{Jasmine}} is throwing in {{ hisd(Nathan) }} honour. It is certainly a feat worth celebrating, the victory over near death and an almost complete re-emergence into a new kind of life. It’s a powdery, misty Sunday, and the grey begins to turn into purple-black. I don’t see any sign of {{ him(Nathan) }}. I haven’t since yesterday.
I bundle into coat, scarf and gloves and collect my keys off the kitchen table, where it seems every story rests comfortably in sight of the pigeon. {{Jasmine}}’s earring peeps out at me from the bookshelf, and it reminds me of the unsuspecting kindness that {{Nathan}} accuses me of for taking {{ her(Jasmine) }} in on the night of the accident. The MSF letter, now wrinkled and creased from droplets of rain that have found their way in, rests spitefully at the top of a pile of others, alongside {{Jasmine}} and {{Nathan}}’s wedding invitation.
I reach to pull the window closed, and hear a shuffling noise, like paper folding itself gently. Grabbing my shoulders, I lean outward. Water has pooled from the rain of the last few days, and it swirls in wretched circles. Rushing around with the grace of a stone, {{ he(pigeon) }} is curled into {{ himself(pigeon) }}, not a beat left in {{ hisd(pigeon) }} miniature heart. {{ Hisd(pigeon) }} eyes are closed and {{ hisd(pigeon) }} beak shut tight, as if words might escape.
