Dynamically rewrite the gender of personae in texts

## Purpose
Given a text with properly parameterized gender placeholders, this library will
generate an alternate version of the text based on user preference of gender. Gabriel García Márquez' first sentence,

> Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was
> to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.

would become

> Many years later, as she faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliana Buendía was
> to remember that distant afternoon when her father took her to discover ice.

## Creating your own texts

### 1. Add Placeholders
Text must have personae gender indicators entered as placeholder text, as well
as a legend that instructs the code which gender should be used for each
persona.

For example, original the *Hundred Years of Solitude* sentence, above, would need
to be entered as:

> Many years later, as {{ he(Aureliano Buendía) }} faced the firing squad,
> Colonel {{ Aureliano Buendía }} was to remember that distant afternoon when
> {{ his(Aureliano Buendía) }} father took {{ him(Aureliano Buendía) }} to
> discover ice.
>
> [[Aureliana Buendía/Aureliano Buendía:female]]

In order to render as male-gendered, the text could be entered as:

> Many years later, as {{ she(Aureliano Buendía) }} faced the firing squad,
> Colonel {{ Aureliano Buendía }} was to remember that distant afternoon when
> {{ herd(Aureliano Buendía) }} father took {{ her(Aureliano Buendía) }} to
> discover ice.
> [[Aureliana Buendía/Aureliano Buendía:male]]

** Note the use of "herd" to differentiate determiner & object. See **Callouts**,
below.

### 1a. Texts with multiple personae
The sentence from D.H Lawrence's *Sons and Lovers*, "He kept her because he never satisfied her", illustrates two personae
working in tandem. The text would be parameterized as:

> {{ He(Paul) }} kept {{ her(Clara) }} because {{ he(Paul) }} never
> satisfied {{ her(Clara) }}.

Adding the legend ``` [[Paulina/Paul:male][Clara/Clark:female]]``` would generate
 the original text, while ```[[Paulina/Paul:female][Clara/Clark:male]]``` would
 reverse the roles:

> She kept him because she never satisfied him.

and ```[[Paulina/Paul:male][Clara/Clark:male]]``` would generate:

> He kept him because he never satisfied him.

### 2. Create the Legend
Text to be processed must include a legend, wrapped in double square brackets,
which may appear anywhere in the text. An example legend:

```[[Mindy/Mork:male][Charlize/Charles:female][Kate/Ken/Kan:trans]]```

Each element in the legend is wrapped in square brackets, and consists of the
gendered proper names for the character, in the order ```FEMALE/MALE/TRANS```.
This is followed by a colon, after which indicates the gender that should be used
in the dynamically generated version of the text.

So, using the legend above, the program will look for a character named "Mindy" or "Mork" and render this character as "Mork" with the male pronoun set. It will
look for a character named "Charlize" or "Charles" and render the character as
"Charlize" with the female pronoun set. It will look for a character named "Kate,"
"Ken" or "Kan," and render the character as "Kan" with a transgender pronoun.

### Expected results
Text to be manipulated must include parameterized persona placeholders, wrapped
in double curly brackets. Examples:

```{{ She(Mindy) }}```
```{{ Mindy }}```
```{{ He(Mindy) }}```

Combined with the example legend, the below placeholder would render as follows:

| Placeholder | Rendered text |
| --- | --- |
| ```{{ She(Mindy) }}``` | He |
| ```{{ Mindy }}``` | Mork |
| ```{{ he(Mindy) }}``` | he |

In comparison, with the legend ```[[Mindy/Mork:female]]```, the same text would
render as:

| Placeholder | Rendered text |
| --- | --- |
| ```{{ She(Mindy) }}``` | She |
| ```{{ Mindy }}``` | Mindy |
| ```{{ he(Mindy) }}``` | she |

Example code implementation:

```php
$text = "{{ She(Mindy) }} sells seashells [[Mindy/Mork:male]]";
$result = GenderedText::process($text);
echo $text; // He sells seashells
```

### Callouts
- An idiosyncrasy of English language pronouns is that, while the male possessive
pronoun "his" (as in "I like **his** shirt") is identical to the determinative
(as in "That shirt is **his**"), the female equivalents differ (i.e., "I like
**her** shirt" vs. "That shirt is **hers**"). Accordingly, male determinative
pronouns must be entered as "hisd" (e.g., ```That shirt is {{ hisd(Mork) }}```)
for differentiation from the possessive "his" (to avoid the result "I like
hers shirt").
- Similarly, the female determiner ("I like **her** hairdo") is identical to the
female object ("I like **her**"), but the male forms differ ("I like **his** hairo" vs.
"I like **him**"). Therefore, the female determiner must be identified as "herd".
